Ba@@ ver@@ e@@ z &apos;s evidence of de@@ generation is not as convinc@@ ing as he belie@@ ves .
for example , he c@@ it@@ es the dra@@ ining away of industrial jobs as the most g@@ lar@@ ing evidence of France &apos;s decline .
but d@@ ein@@ du@@ stri@@ alization is common to all advanced countries .
indeed , France does actually better than most of its rich country ri@@ v@@ als and , unlike Germany , the UK , or the US , has re@@ tained the same global market share in the industrial sector that it had in the early 1970 &apos;s .
moreover , according to a better measure of comp@@ te@@ ti@@ tiveness , foreign investment , France does very well .
according to a recent report by the Economic An@@ aly@@ sis Council , direct investment in France gre@@ w to 60 billion e@@ uro@@ s in 2001 , almost twi@@ ce that of Germany .
French cost competitiveness also improved ( by 20 % ) in the last three decades , with higher productivity off@@ setting rapid wage growth .
but the core of France &apos;s long @-@ run economic problems is precisely the fear of losing industrial jobs .
France remains a strong industrial power in traditional areas such as autom@@ o@@ bi@@ le and a@@ ero@@ space industries , but it is falling behind in innovative markets , where smaller companies spread new technologies .
France , for inst@@ ance , sp@@ ends only $ 30 billion annually on high te@@ ch R &amp; amp ; D , compared with $ 5@@ 1 billion in Germany , $ 9@@ 8 billion in Japan , and $ 2@@ 65 billion in the US .
in short , Ba@@ ver@@ e@@ z &apos;s analysis points in the wrong direction .
France has under@@ gone a set of criti@@ cally important reforms over the past two decades : economic and financial liberalization , elimin@@ ation of price and foreign exchange controls , the end of credit restrictions , European liberalization , reduced inflation and trade deficits , the adv@@ ent of the euro and the forced globalization of the country &apos;s firms .
the French mal@@ ai@@ se has nothing to do with any of them .
France &apos;s problem is that it fail@@ s to recognize the new world of which it already is a part .
French state capitalism is de@@ ad , and France is fin@@ ding it hard to come to terms with its pass@@ ing .
indeed , France must be the only country in which a Prime Minister , Li@@ on@@ el Jo@@ sp@@ in , fe@@ els ob@@ li@@ ged to a@@ po@@ logi@@ ze the day after for sa@@ ying on T@@ V that &quot; the state is not om@@ ni@@ po@@ tent . &quot;
there are many reasons for this French sch@@ y@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia , but a critical one has to do with the political game of the past 20 years .
until 198@@ 1 , France had a clear divi@@ sion between right and left .
since then , both the Mit@@ ter@@ and and Chira@@ c administ@@ ra@@ tions bl@@ un@@ ted their ide@@ ological ed@@ ge in order to carry the difficult process of adjustment towards Europe and globalization .
a round of &quot; sho@@ ck therap@@ y &quot; Ã  la M@@ r@@ s@@ . That@@ cher two decades ago might have for@@ ged a new political con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
but the con@@ sen@@ su@@ al dri@@ b@@ b@@ ling out of reforms allowed the French to live in one world and think in another .
this is a key reason for the political cat@@ ac@@ l@@ y@@ sm that explo@@ ded during the last presidential campaign , when the far @-@ right leader Jean @-@ M@@ ari@@ e Le P@@ en reached the second round of the presidential election , ahead of the inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent Prime Minister , Li@@ on@@ el Jo@@ sp@@ in .
the rise of the extreme left , which ga@@ ther@@ ed 10 % of the vote during that presidential campaign , also at@@ tests to this political failure .
France needs a political revolution more than an economic one if it is to come to terms with reality , part of which is that &quot; French decline &quot; is a fear of the French people &apos;s own making .
the par@@ an@@ o@@ id St@@ yle in Economi@@ cs
new D@@ E@@ L@@ H@@ I - W@@ h@@ y do high @-@ profi@@ le economic t@@ us@@ s@@ les turn so quickly to ad hom@@ in@@ em attacks ?
perhaps the most well @-@ known recent example has been the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate Paul K@@ ru@@ g@@ man &apos;s campaign against the economists Car@@ men R@@ ein@@ hart and Ken@@ net@@ h Ro@@ go@@ ff , in which he mo@@ ved quickly from criticism of an er@@ ror in one of their pap@@ ers to char@@ ges about their commitment to academi@@ c transparency .
for those who know these two super@@ b international macro@@ economists , as I do , it is evi@@ dent that these al@@ leg@@ ations should pro@@ mp@@ tly be dis@@ mis@@ sed .
but there is the larger question of why the par@@ an@@ o@@ id style has become so promin@@ ent .
part of the answer is that economics is an in@@ ex@@ act science , with exc@@ ep@@ tions to almost every pattern of behavior that economists take for gran@@ ted .
for example , economists predic@@ t that higher prices for a good will reduce demand for it .
but students of economics will no doubt re@@ member an early en@@ counter with &quot; Gi@@ ff@@ en goods , &quot; which viol@@ ate the usual pattern .
when tor@@ ti@@ ll@@ as become more expensive , a poor Mexi@@ can wor@@ ker may e@@ at more of them , because she now has to cut back on more expensive food like me@@ at .
such &quot; viol@@ ations &quot; occur elsewhere as well .
cust@@ om@@ ers often value a good more when its price goes up .
one reason may be its sign@@ aling value .
an expensive hand@@ cra@@ f@@ ted me@@ ch@@ ani@@ cal wat@@ ch may tell time no more ac@@ cur@@ ately than a che@@ ap quar@@ tz model ; but , because few people can afford one , bu@@ ying it sign@@ als that the ow@@ ner is rich .
similarly , investors flo@@ ck to sto@@ cks that have appreci@@ ated , because they have &quot; moment@@ um . &quot;
the point is that economic behavior is complex and can v@@ ary among individuals , over time , between goods , and across cul@@ tures .
physi@@ ci@@ sts do not need to know the behavior of every m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le to predic@@ t how a gas will be@@ have under pressure .
economists cannot be so sang@@ u@@ ine .
under some conditions , individual behavi@@ or@@ al ab@@ er@@ ra@@ tions canc@@ el one another out , making crow@@ ds more predic@@ table than individuals .
but , under other conditions , individuals influence one another in such a way that the crow@@ d becomes a her@@ d , led by a few .
the difficul@@ ties for economic policymakers do not stop there .
economic institutions can have different effects , depen@@ ding on their quality .
in the run @-@ up to the 2008 financial crisis , macro@@ economists ten@@ ded to assu@@ me away the financial sector in their models of advanced economies .
with no significant financial crisis since the Great Depression , it was conven@@ i@@ ent to take for gran@@ ted that the financial pl@@ um@@ bing worked in the back@@ ground .
models , thus simp@@ li@@ fied , suggest@@ ed policies that seemed to work - &amp; # 160 ; that is , until the pl@@ um@@ bing backed up .
and the pl@@ um@@ bing mal@@ func@@ tioned because her@@ d behavior - shap@@ ed by policies in ways that we are only now coming to understand - overwhel@@ med it .
so , why not let evidence , rather than theory , gui@@ de policy ?
unfortunately , it is hard to get clear @-@ cut evidence of caus@@ ality .
if high national debt is associated with slow economic growth , is it because excessive debt impe@@ des growth , or because slow growth causes countries to accumul@@ ate more debt ?
many an econom@@ etri@@ ci@@ an &apos;s care@@ er has been built on fin@@ ding a cle@@ ver way to establish the direction of caus@@ ality .
unfortunately , many of these meth@@ ods cannot be app@@ lied to the most important questions facing economic policymakers .
so the evidence does not really tell us whether a heavily inde@@ b@@ ted country should pay down its debt or borro@@ w and invest more .
moreover , what seem like obvious , com@@ mon@@ sense policy solutions all too often have un@@ intended consequences , because a policy &apos;s targets are not pas@@ sive ob@@ jects , as in physi@@ cs , but active ag@@ ents who re@@ act in un@@ predic@@ table ways .
for example , price controls , rather than lo@@ wer@@ ing prices , often cause s@@ car@@ city and the emer@@ gence of a bl@@ ack market in which controlled commodi@@ ties cost significantly more .
all of this implies that economic policymakers require an enormous do@@ se of hu@@ mi@@ lity , open@@ ness to various altern@@ atives ( including the possibility that they might be wrong ) , and a willingness to experi@@ ment .
this does not mean that our economic knowledge cannot gui@@ de us , only that what works in theory - or worked in the past or elsewhere - should be pres@@ cri@@ bed with an appropriate degree of self @-@ doubt .
but , for economists who ac@@ tively engage the public , it is hard to influence he@@ ar@@ ts and min@@ ds by quali@@ fying one &apos;s analysis and he@@ d@@ ging one &apos;s pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions .
better to ass@@ ert one &apos;s knowledge un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally , especially if past academi@@ c hon@@ ors cer@@ ti@@ fy one &apos;s claims of exper@@ ti@@ se .
this is not an entirely bad approach if it results in shar@@ per public debate .
the dar@@ k side of such cer@@ titu@@ de , however , is the way it influ@@ ences how these economists engage contrary opini@@ ons .
how do you con@@ vin@@ ce your pas@@ sion@@ ate fol@@ lo@@ wers if other , equally cre@@ denti@@ aled , economists take the opposi@@ te view ?
all too often , the path to easy influence is to im@@ pu@@ g@@ n the other side &apos;s mo@@ tives and meth@@ ods , rather than recogni@@ zing and challeng@@ ing an op@@ posing argument &apos;s points .
instead of fo@@ ster@@ ing public dialogue and educ@@ ating the public , the public is often left in the dar@@ k .
and it dis@@ coura@@ ges yo@@ unger , less cre@@ denti@@ aled economists from enter@@ ing the public dis@@ course .
in their mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al research on cent@@ uries of public and sovereign debt , the norm@@ ally very care@@ ful R@@ ein@@ hart and Ro@@ go@@ ff made an er@@ ror in one of their working pap@@ ers .
the er@@ ror is in neither their pri@@ ze @-@ winn@@ ing 2009 book nor in a sub@@ sequ@@ ent widely re@@ ad pap@@ er respon@@ ding to the academi@@ c debate about their work .
R@@ ein@@ hart and Ro@@ go@@ ff &apos;s research bro@@ adly shows that GDP growth is s@@ lower at high levels of public debt .
while there is a legitimate debate about whether this implies that high debt causes slow growth , K@@ ru@@ g@@ man turned to ques@@ tioning their mo@@ tives .
he acc@@ used R@@ ein@@ hart and Ro@@ go@@ ff of de@@ liber@@ ately keeping their data out of the public dom@@ ain .
R@@ ein@@ hart and Ro@@ go@@ ff , sho@@ ck@@ ed by this char@@ ge - t@@ ant@@ amount to an acc@@ us@@ ation of academi@@ c di@@ sh@@ on@@ est@@ y - rele@@ ased a care@@ ful re@@ bu@@ t@@ tal , including online evidence that they had not been reti@@ cent about sharing their data .
in fair@@ ness , given K@@ ru@@ g@@ man &apos;s strong and public positions , he has been subject to immen@@ se personal criticism by many on the right .
perhaps the par@@ an@@ o@@ id style in public debate , foc@@ using on mo@@ tives rather than subst@@ ance , is a us@@ eful defen@@ sive tac@@ tic against ra@@ bi@@ d critics .
unfortunately , it sp@@ il@@ ls over into counter@@ ing more reason@@ ed differences of opinion as well .
perhaps resp@@ ec@@ t@@ ful debate in economics is possible only in academi@@ a .
the public dis@@ course is poor@@ er for this .
the defe@@ ated R@@ em@@ ain de@@ fi@@ ant
Har@@ are : before Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we &apos;s Pre@@ siden@@ tial election earlier this month , I believed that if the election were not hand@@ led proper@@ ly , there would be serious fall@@ out in the country and throughout Sou@@ thern Africa .
despite the sha@@ do@@ ws of war and terrorism , I called for a fair and free election .
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we &apos;s people did not get one .
instead , they go@@ t terrorism .
in the two years that led up to the Pre@@ siden@@ tial vote , the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we were sub@@ jected to severe in@@ timi@@ d@@ ation , har@@ ass@@ ment and fear , all of which was car@@ ried out as part of a broader program of state @-@ sp@@ on@@ so@@ red terrorism by Robert Mu@@ gabe &apos;s Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we African National Union @-@ Pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tic Front ( Z@@ an@@ u @-@ P@@ F ) .
Z@@ an@@ u terrorism was conduc@@ ted by ro@@ gue el@@ ements among the ve@@ ter@@ ans of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we &apos;s war of independence two decades ago , as well as by government mili@@ ti@@ am@@ en and y@@ ou@@ ths , all of whom were ac@@ tively ai@@ ded by the police .
this in@@ timi@@ d@@ ation and violence meant that my party , the Mo@@ vement for Democratic Ch@@ ange ( M@@ DC ) could not reach the elector@@ ate in large parts of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
in addition , the government of President Mu@@ gabe , my opp@@ on@@ ent , effectively di@@ sen@@ fr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ ed hundreds of thousands of urban voters , particularly in the capital city of Har@@ are and in the city of Ch@@ it@@ ung@@ wi@@ z@@ a .
because of an in@@ adequate number of poll@@ ing st@@ ations , I believe that in Har@@ are and Ch@@ it@@ ung@@ wi@@ z@@ a alone more than 3@@ 6@@ 0,000 people stood in a qu@@ eu@@ e to vote but never gained the opportunity to c@@ ast their bal@@ lot .
my concerns about the legitimacy of the election results are further raised by inter@@ ference by Mu@@ gabe &apos;s mili@@ ti@@ a , whose members prev@@ ented the M@@ DC from plac@@ ing poll@@ ing ag@@ ents in 5@@ 2 % of rural poll@@ ing st@@ ations .
by the end of the vot@@ ing , our party had no obser@@ vers at 6 out of 10 rural st@@ ations .
this effectively meant that Mu@@ gabe &apos;s supporters could have their way at these st@@ ations .
we are comp@@ il@@ ing a comprehensive list of the poll@@ ing st@@ ations where Z@@ an@@ u supporters had so@@ lit@@ ary control .
in our investi@@ g@@ ations so far , a pattern has emerged even at this early stage : these poll@@ ing st@@ ations recor@@ ded the highest number of voters for Mu@@ gabe .
in light of all the evidence , I cannot accept the Pre@@ siden@@ tial election results in which Robert Mu@@ gabe , the si@@ t@@ ting president , was declared a winn@@ er this month with 5@@ 6 % of the 3 million vot@@ es tal@@ lied .
the official results do not reflect the true will of the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we and are il@@ legitimate in the e@@ yes of the people .
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we &apos;s people have been che@@ ated of their right to fre@@ ely and democra@@ ti@@ cally el@@ ect a President of their choice .
the con@@ test over the election results is a political issue that must be resol@@ ved politically .
food and fuel are in short supply , jobs are v@@ ani@@ shing , inflation is running at more than 100 % .
the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we deser@@ ve a cele@@ b@@ ration for their coura@@ ge and determin@@ ation .
we may yet get one .
as I wri@@ te , I am s@@ ad@@ den@@ ed because Mu@@ gabe &apos;s regime remains in@@ tent on def@@ ying the people &apos;s will .
whatever may happen , I as the people &apos;s loy@@ al serv@@ ant am with them all the way .
the government may want to ar@@ rest me .
indeed , I was ar@@ re@@ sted for tre@@ as@@ on even before the election .
at worst , they may even wish to kil@@ l me .
but the government will never destro@@ y the spiri@@ t of the people to rec@@ la@@ im their rights and power .
the power to achieve democratic change is in our hands .
we may have mom@@ ents of fear in the days ahead , but we must never let des@@ pa@@ ir overwhel@@ m us .
the ti@@ de of political change is ir@@ rever@@ sible .
but we must be prepared to pay a high price for our freedom .
President Mu@@ gabe and his cr@@ oni@@ es are af@@ ra@@ id of the people and we have he@@ ard they may do anything to kil@@ l the m@@ essen@@ ger .
if they do , I only ask that the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we remain strong and carry on the work that we began together .
among ordinary Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans wal@@ k her@@ o@@ es - her@@ o@@ es who wa@@ ited hours and hours to vote , her@@ o@@ es who ref@@ used to be turned away .
these are the her@@ o@@ es of the new Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we whose vo@@ ices must be he@@ ard around the world .
together , we tra@@ vel@@ ed a very har@@ sh road together to achieve democratic change in my country .
ra@@ rely in the history of hum@@ ank@@ in@@ d have a people faced such bru@@ ta@@ lity while re@@ taining such gra@@ cious ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ance .
I reali@@ ze that the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we are imp@@ ati@@ ent .
I understand why .
but they must wait peac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly for the political process to un@@ fol@@ d .
they will not let this election stand but neither will they succ@@ um@@ b to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s pro@@ voc@@ ative tra@@ ps and res@@ ort to violence .
the people of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we want constitutional change , legal change , legitimate change , and they are going to ob@@ tain it in spi@@ te of all the obstac@@ les .
in this , we know we are not alone .
we know that throughout Africa , the will of the elector@@ ate has been th@@ war@@ ted .
it appears in the majority of African states , wh@@ en@@ ever you have elections , you have ir@@ regul@@ ari@@ ties , fr@@ au@@ d , che@@ ating .
there &apos;s always a crisis of elections in Africa .
there is , sad to say , a lack of sin@@ cer@@ ity on the part of governments across this continent when it comes time to give people the right to choose .
but those who wish otherwise can take hope .
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we &apos;s struggle is not over .
we have time to t@@ ally the lessons for Africa , and the world , of our experience .
my people are in their h@@ our of greatest need .
I ple@@ dge not to aband@@ on them .
the Del@@ ay@@ ed Pro@@ mise of He@@ alth @-@ C@@ are I@@ T
Washington , DC - B@@ ec@@ au@@ se information technology ( I@@ T ) has so quickly trans@@ formed people &apos;s da@@ i@@ ly lives , we tend to for@@ get how much things have changed from the not @-@ so @-@ dist@@ ant past .
today , millions of people around the world regul@@ arly sho@@ p online ; down@@ lo@@ ad entire mo@@ vi@@ es , boo@@ ks , and other media on@@ to wi@@ rel@@ ess devi@@ ces ; bank at A@@ T@@ M@@ s wh@@ er@@ ever they choose ; and self @-@ book entire tri@@ ps and ch@@ eck themselves in at air@@ ports elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ cally .
but there is one sector of our lives where adop@@ tion of information technology has la@@ gg@@ ed con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ously : health care .
some parts of the world are doing better than others in this respect .
rese@@ arch@@ ers from the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Fund recently repor@@ ted that some high @-@ income countries , including the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , have made great stri@@ des in encoura@@ ging the use of elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c medical recor@@ ds ( E@@ M@@ R ) among primary @-@ care physi@@ ci@@ ans .
indeed , in those countries , the practice is now nearly universal .
yet some other high @-@ income countries , such as the United States and Can@@ ada , are not keeping up .
E@@ M@@ R us@@ age in America , the home of App@@ le and Goog@@ le , stands at only 6@@ 9 % .
the situation in the US is particularly g@@ lar@@ ing , given that health care accounts for a bi@@ g@@ ger share of GDP than manufacturing , reta@@ il , finance , or insurance . &amp; # 160 ; Mo@@ re@@ over , most health I@@ T systems in use in America today are designed prim@@ arily to facilit@@ ate efficient bil@@ ling , rather than efficient care , putting the business interests of ho@@ spit@@ als and cl@@ ini@@ cs ahead of the needs of doc@@ tors and patients .
that is why many Americans can easily go online and ch@@ eck the health of their bank account , but cannot ch@@ eck the results of their most recent la@@ b work .
another difference between I@@ T in US health care and in other industries is the former &apos;s lack of inter@@ oper@@ ability .
in other words , a ho@@ spit@@ al &apos;s I@@ T system often cannot &quot; talk &quot; to others .
even ho@@ spit@@ als that are part of the same system sometimes struggle to share pati@@ ent information .
as a result , today &apos;s health I@@ T systems act more like a &quot; frequ@@ ent fl@@ yer car@@ d &quot; designed to en@@ force cust@@ om@@ er loy@@ al@@ ty to a particular ho@@ spit@@ al , rather than an &quot; A@@ T@@ M car@@ d &quot; that enab@@ les you and your doc@@ tor to access your health information wh@@ en@@ ever and wh@@ er@@ ever needed .
ordin@@ arily , lack of inter@@ oper@@ ability is an ir@@ rit@@ ating in@@ conven@@ i@@ ence .
in a medical emer@@ gency , it can impose life @-@ threat@@ ening del@@ a@@ ys in care .
a third way that health I@@ T in America di@@ ff@@ ers from consumer I@@ T is us@@ ability .
the desig@@ n of most consumer We@@ b si@@ tes is so obvious that one needs no in@@ struc@@ tions to use them .
within min@@ utes , a seven year old can te@@ ach her@@ self to play a complex game on an i@@ P@@ ad .
but a new@@ ly hi@@ red ne@@ uro@@ sur@@ ge@@ on with 27 years of education may have to re@@ ad a thi@@ ck us@@ er manu@@ al , atten@@ d te@@ di@@ ous cl@@ asses , and accept peri@@ o@@ di@@ c tu@@ tor@@ ing from a &quot; change ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on &quot; to ma@@ ster the various steps required to use his ho@@ spit@@ al &apos;s I@@ T system .
not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , despite its theo@@ reti@@ cal benefits , health I@@ T has few f@@ ans among health @-@ care provi@@ ders .
in fact , many comp@@ lain that it slow@@ s them down .
does this mean that health I@@ T is a wa@@ ste of time and money ?
absol@@ ut@@ ely not .
in 2005 , colle@@ ag@@ ues of our@@ s at the R@@ A@@ N@@ D Cor@@ por@@ ation pro@@ jected that America could save more than $ 80 billion a year if health care could rep@@ lic@@ ate the I@@ T @-@ driven productivity gains obser@@ ved in other industries .
the fact that the US has not got@@ ten there yet is not a problem of vision , but of less @-@ than @-@ ide@@ al implement@@ ation .
other industries , including banking and reta@@ il trade , strugg@@ led with I@@ T until they go@@ t it right .
the gap between what I@@ T promised and what it deli@@ vered in the early days was so stark that experts called it the &quot; I@@ T productivity parado@@ x . &quot;
once these industries figu@@ red out how to make their I@@ T systems more efficient , inter@@ oper@@ able , and us@@ er @-@ fri@@ end@@ ly , and then reali@@ g@@ ned their proc@@ esses to leverage technology &apos;s cap@@ abilities , productivity so@@ ared .
in America , as in much of the world , health care is late to the I@@ T game , and is experi@@ en@@ cing these growing pa@@ ins only now . &amp; # 160 ; Bu@@ t health @-@ care provi@@ ders can shor@@ ten the process of trans@@ formation by lear@@ ning from other industries .
the US government is trying to help .
in 2009 , Congress pass@@ ed the He@@ alth In@@ formation Tech@@ nology for Economic and C@@ l@@ ini@@ cal He@@ alth ( H@@ I@@ T@@ EC@@ H ) Ac@@ t .
H@@ I@@ T@@ EC@@ H has un@@ deni@@ ably acceler@@ ated I@@ T adop@@ tion among health @-@ care provi@@ ders .
yet the problems of us@@ ability and inter@@ oper@@ ability per@@ sist .
glob@@ ally , the health I@@ T industry should not wait to be forced by government regulators into doing a better job .
develop@@ ers can boost the pace of adop@@ tion by creating more stand@@ ar@@ di@@ zed systems that are easier to use , truly inter@@ oper@@ able , and afford patients greater access to and control over their personal health data .
health @-@ care provi@@ ders and ho@@ spit@@ al systems can dramatically boost the impact of health I@@ T by re@@ engine@@ ering traditional practices to take full advantage of its cap@@ abilities .
if America is any indic@@ ator , the sky is the limit when it comes to potential gains from health I@@ T .
according to the Institute of Me@@ dic@@ ine , the US currently wa@@ stes more than $ 7@@ 50 billion per year on un@@ necessary or in@@ efficient health @-@ care services , excessive administ@@ rative costs , high prices , medical fr@@ au@@ d , and mis@@ sed opportunities for pre@@ vention .
proper@@ ly app@@ lied , health I@@ T can improve health care in all of these di@@ men@@ sions .
the pay@@ off will be worth it .
indeed , as with the adop@@ tion of I@@ T elsewhere , we may soon won@@ der how health care could have been deli@@ vered any other way .
the Del@@ u@@ sion of De@@ bt for@@ gi@@ veness
Rom@@ e : governments from around the world will ga@@ ther in Brussels under UN au@@ spi@@ ces on May 1@@ 4@@ th to disc@@ uss the p@@ light of poor countries .
as they talk , the leaders of rich countries may stri@@ ke a self @-@ satis@@ fied pose , rec@@ all@@ ing as they do the old pro@@ ver@@ b , which sa@@ ys that for@@ gi@@ veness is di@@ v@@ ine .
for little more than a year ago they agreed to for@@ give much of the debt of the world &apos;s poorest countries .
of course , for@@ giving the debts of the poor is und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly no@@ ble .
s@@ adly , not everything that is no@@ ble is sm@@ art and effective .
many of the debts of poor countries that have been for@@ given were already considered as , de facto , lost and thus un@@ reco@@ ver@@ able .
interest and princip@@ al payments made by many poor countries were , as a result of this , much smaller than what was actually o@@ wed .
E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , for example , was paying a su@@ m equal to 10 % of its exports ; payments of 70 % would have been needed to co@@ ver the nomin@@ al value of its debt .
the C@@ olo@@ g@@ ne A@@ gre@@ ement on poor countries with the highest level of debt - the highly In@@ deb@@ ted Po@@ or Coun@@ tries ( H@@ IP@@ C ) initiative - that was agreed to last year declared that debts will be for@@ given up to the point at which interest payments become &quot; sustainable &quot; : in other words , the agreement sub@@ stitu@@ tes un@@ reco@@ ver@@ able debt for a debt lo@@ ad that is nomin@@ ally lower but &quot; real . &quot;
according to calcul@@ ations by Britain &apos;s Treasury , with the H@@ IP@@ C agreement Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que pa@@ ys about the same propor@@ tion in debt service as it was paying before the accor@@ d was signed .
more than a sh@@ ell game is at work here , however .
for the countries accor@@ ded debt for@@ gi@@ veness under the H@@ IP@@ C must ren@@ oun@@ ce other forms of aid .
this restric@@ tion led G@@ han@@ a to ask to op@@ t out of the H@@ IP@@ C al@@ together .
uncertainty about the numbers involved in the exerci@@ se in debt for@@ gi@@ veness is large , but reli@@ able World Bank calcul@@ ations show that , for the 9 countries in the most advanced st@@ ages of H@@ IP@@ C , interest expendi@@ tures should go down to 10 % of the value of exports .
this amounts to a saving of about 1.@@ 4 % of GDP - the ac@@ tual number will perhaps be larger by a few deci@@ mal points here and there when the effects of bilateral debt for@@ gi@@ veness are added .
a resp@@ ec@@ table outcome , but not an enormous amount .
independent of these numbers , however , the debt for@@ gi@@ veness debate per@@ pet@@ u@@ ates the le@@ gend that the West is responsible for the op@@ pres@@ sive debt bur@@ dens of poor countries , and , more generally , for the s@@ car@@ city of assistance to help them fight poverty .
the reality is the opposi@@ te .
few developing countries are seriously eng@@ aged in fighting poverty .
in many of them , public expendi@@ ture favor the middle and up@@ per middle cl@@ asses ; above all , it favor@@ s city d@@ w@@ ell@@ ers .
economies in most poor countries , indeed , are ri@@ gg@@ ed against their own poor in a vari@@ ety of ways :
â¢ by arti@@ fici@@ ally in@@ fl@@ ated public employment : with high sal@@ aries being paid to state workers relative to the average wage , state jobs often provide li@@ fe@@ time employment for children of the middle cl@@ asses ;
â¢ because pen@@ sions are available only for a few exec@@ uti@@ ves in the formal sector and for state employe@@ es , with nothing provided to the rural poor ;
â¢ because free universi@@ ty education is a form of re@@ distribution from poor to rich because the poor are tax@@ ed to pay for universi@@ ty , but ra@@ rely get to go ;
â¢ because expendi@@ tures for primary education often end up being cap@@ tured by te@@ ach@@ ers &quot; uni@@ ons in order to guarantee pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ges for their members ;
â¢ through health expendi@@ tures that are often concent@@ r@@ ated on ho@@ spit@@ als in relatively prosp@@ erous and politically important urban areas ;
â¢ because free water and electricity are mostly a sub@@ sid@@ y for the urban middle class and for rich farmers .
overwhel@@ ming em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal evidence ( provided in large part by the World Bank , a place ke@@ en on the idea of aid ) pro@@ ves that the development of the poorest countries is block@@ ed , prim@@ arily , by government in@@ efficiency and the corruption .
for development to take off , countries require moder@@ ately stable and efficient governments pursu@@ ing appropriate economic policies .
South Korea is the best example of what can be achieved in this way .
in 19@@ 60 , it had a per capita income lower than Som@@ ali@@ a ; today it is a member of the OECD .
em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal research amp@@ ly demonstr@@ ates that development assistance is largely ine@@ ff@@ ective because it is given in@@ discrimin@@ ately to governments who use it to en@@ rich a tin@@ y elite .
a recent do@@ cu@@ ment by a World Bank exper@@ t , W@@ illi@@ am E@@ ast@@ er@@ ly , shows that the same conclu@@ sion also hol@@ ds for debt for@@ gi@@ veness initiatives .
of course , the West is not bl@@ am@@ eless .
it er@@ red in giving too much credit , not too little , to poor countries , and by hand@@ ing out credit according to political needs rather than by ri@@ gor@@ ous cri@@ teri@@ a related to fighting poverty .
the e@@ x @-@ imperi@@ al powers fa@@ vo@@ red their e@@ x @-@ coloni@@ es , regardless of whether they deser@@ ved assistance or how they used it .
during the Cold War , alliance loy@@ al@@ ty rather than economic motiv@@ ations , determined the flow of aid .
a cor@@ rupt but al@@ lied government was inv@@ ari@@ ably prefer@@ red to an hon@@ est , non @-@ al@@ lied one .
in addition , many of the bilateral credi@@ ts now being canc@@ eled were in reality commercial credit guarante@@ es which benef@@ it@@ ted businesses in credi@@ tor countries more than poor countries .
in Italy , things were even worse : development assistance was largely dis@@ bur@@ sed in order to favor foreign fri@@ ends of Italian politicians .
so debt for@@ gi@@ veness , even if mor@@ ally commen@@ dable , risks sen@@ ding two mis@@ leading mess@@ ages : it t@@ ells the ruling cl@@ asses of poor deb@@ tor countries that corruption pa@@ ys ; and it rein@@ forces the Western public &apos;s belief that the problems of poor countries are caused by Western policies .
if these two points are not confron@@ ted , debt for@@ gi@@ veness will end up la@@ ying the found@@ ations for a new cycle of inde@@ b@@ te@@ d@@ ness , corruption , and abi@@ ding poverty .
the de@@ mise of Parli@@ am@@ ents
August is the traditional month when parli@@ am@@ ents rec@@ ess for the summer .
it offers a moment to exam@@ ine why they are so en@@ fe@@ e@@ b@@ led .
across Europe , it is not only British Prime Minister T@@ ony Blair who is acc@@ used of &quot; presiden@@ ti@@ alism &quot; nowadays .
German Chanc@@ ellor Ger@@ hard Sch@@ rÃ¶@@ der faces the same char@@ ge in the current German election campaign .
Prime Minister S@@ il@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi of Italy , indeed , does not even like being called Prime Minister .
because he is techni@@ cally President of the Council ( of ministers ) , he insi@@ sts on using the ti@@ tle of President .
France , of course , is a presidential democracy .
to many , &quot; presiden@@ ti@@ alism &quot; so@@ unds like the American constitution ; but those who sus@@ p@@ ect in today &apos;s trend another fac@@ et of the Ameri@@ c@@ anization of Europe are wrong .
American pre@@ sidents have powers which are sever@@ ely restric@@ ted by Congress via the US constitution ; they are but one in a tri@@ ad of separ@@ ate powers .
Europe &apos;s &quot; presidential &quot; prime ministers , on the contrary , are what a British L@@ or@@ d Chanc@@ ellor once called , &quot; elec@@ tive dic@@ t@@ ators . &quot;
this means , above all , that they have c@@ eas@@ ed to take parli@@ am@@ ents seriously .
some Prime Minist@@ ers ra@@ rely atten@@ d their parli@@ am@@ ents .
when they gra@@ ci@@ ously con@@ sent to appear , they are tre@@ ated with de@@ ference .
parli@@ am@@ ents are in some cases hand@@ ma@@ i@@ dens of the exec@@ utive rather than the source of sovereignty .
Prime Minister Berlusconi has persu@@ ad@@ ed the Italian Parliament to p@@ ass legislation which prim@@ arily benefits him and his business interests .
the mo@@ ther of parli@@ am@@ ents itself , the British parliament at West@@ min@@ ster , frequ@@ ently cuts short deb@@ ates by a proce@@ du@@ ral de@@ vice known as the &quot; gu@@ ill@@ ot@@ ine , &quot; so that important legislation , like the current A@@ sy@@ l@@ um Bill , remains largely un@@ deb@@ ated in the House of Comm@@ ons .
( the ab@@ sur@@ d consequ@@ ence is that the un@@ elected House of L@@ or@@ ds becomes the real legi@@ s@@ lat@@ ure of the country . )
all governments have ac@@ qui@@ red the hab@@ it of using sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y legislation by or@@ ders and regulations without parliamentary control .
the European Union s@@ ets a particularly bad example in all this .
its legi@@ s@@ lat@@ ure is the Council of Minist@@ ers which sometimes allow@@ s the elected Parliament to engage in a little &quot; co @-@ decision @-@ making . &quot;
the Council of course me@@ ets in c@@ am@@ era , that is without public sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y .
how could this happen ?
what is the reason for the appar@@ ent de@@ mise of the central institution of democracy , parliament ?
why is it no longer the place in which the represent@@ atives of the people debate great issues and hold the exec@@ utive to account ?
is democracy itself at risk ?
one can think of a number of reasons for the evi@@ sc@@ er@@ ation of parli@@ am@@ ents .
one is globalization .
decisions have emi@@ gr@@ ated from the sp@@ ac@@ es for which parli@@ am@@ ents are elected .
they take place in remo@@ te and often un@@ known places .
these can be the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ oms of companies , or private international me@@ et@@ ings of leaders , or just a course of events which escap@@ es all controls .
the collapse of the &quot; new economy &quot; is an example , but in a c@@ uri@@ ous way also the prob@@ able attack on Iraq will also be arri@@ ved at in such a way .
even if national parli@@ am@@ ents tried to come to gri@@ ps with such developments , they would fail .
another reason is the separ@@ ation of the political game from the lives and concerns of most people .
parties have become mach@@ ines for alloc@@ ating power rather than for ga@@ ther@@ ing and repres@@ enting the interests of citizens .
the party game has lost its represent@@ ative quality .
as a result , leaders have developed a tenden@@ cy to turn directly to the people without allowing much debate .
this can be done by opinion poll@@ s and the use of focus groups ; it can also be achieved by refer@@ en@@ da and ple@@ bis@@ c@@ it@@ es .
in both cases , parli@@ am@@ ents become disp@@ ens@@ able .
the danger of such developments is that they strengthen an already strong trend towards a new authorit@@ ari@@ an@@ ism .
the political class becomes a kind of n@@ om@@ en@@ kl@@ at@@ ur@@ a of leaders who pre@@ fer popul@@ ar@@ ity to debate .
they find it aw@@ k@@ ward to give reasons for their policies and regard parli@@ am@@ ents as no more than a reser@@ vo@@ ir for those with whom they are prepared to share power .
as reason@@ ed debate falls by the wa@@ y@@ side , citizens lose interest in politics .
they pursue their affairs and let those in power go@@ ver@@ n .
along with parties and parli@@ am@@ ents , elections have lost their char@@ m .
declining vot@@ er tur@@ n@@ out t@@ ells the story .
the de@@ mise of parli@@ am@@ ents is above all a decline in democratic debate and sc@@ ru@@ tin@@ y .
it is not a development which defen@@ ders of the constitution of liber@@ ty can accept .
the time has come for a re@@ vol@@ t of parli@@ am@@ ents against both the ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ance of those in power and vot@@ er ap@@ a@@ thy .
in a sense , we need more rather than less presiden@@ ti@@ alism in Europe , at least if this is understood in the pro@@ per American way , in which legisl@@ ative and exec@@ utive powers are separ@@ ately legitim@@ ated and equally strong .
the de@@ mise of the Development Ro@@ und
hopes for a development round in world trade - opening up opportunities for developing countries to grow and reduce poverty - now seem d@@ ash@@ ed .
though cro@@ co@@ di@@ le te@@ ars may be shed all around , the extent of dis@@ appoin@@ tment needs to be c@@ ali@@ br@@ ated : P@@ as@@ cal L@@ am@@ y , the head of the World Trade Organization , had long worked to di@@ min@@ ish expectations , so much so that it was clear that whatever emerged would bring , at most , limited benefits to poor countries .
the failure hardly comes as a surprise : the United States and the European Union had long ago ren@@ eg@@ ed on the promises they made in 2001 at D@@ oh@@ a to rec@@ ti@@ fy the imbalances of the last round of trade negotiations - a round so un@@ fair that the world &apos;s poorest countries were actually made worse off .
once again , America &apos;s lack of commitment to multilater@@ alism , its ob@@ stin@@ acy , and its willingness to put political ex@@ pe@@ di@@ ency above principles - and even its own national interests - has tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed .
with elections lo@@ om@@ ing in November , President George W. Bush could not &quot; s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce &quot; the 2@@ 5@@ ,000 we@@ althy cot@@ ton farmers or the 1@@ 0,000 prosp@@ erous ri@@ ce farmers and their campaign contribu@@ tions .
sel@@ dom have so many had to give up so much to protect the interests of so few .
the talks bo@@ gg@@ ed down over agri@@ culture , where subsidies and trade restrictions remain so much higher than in manufacturing .
with 70 % or so of people in developing countries depen@@ ding directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly on agri@@ culture , they are the los@@ ers under the current regime .
but the focus on agri@@ culture diver@@ ted attention from a far broader agenda that could have been pursu@@ ed in ways that would have benef@@ ited both North and the South .
for example , so @-@ called &quot; es@@ cal@@ ating tari@@ ffs , &quot; which tax proc@@ essed goods at a far higher rate than un@@ proc@@ essed products mean that manufacturing tari@@ ffs dis@@ coura@@ ge developing countries from under@@ taking the higher value @-@ added activities that create jobs and boost incomes .
perhaps the most ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous example is America &apos;s $ 0.@@ 5@@ 4 per g@@ all@@ on im@@ port tari@@ ff on eth@@ an@@ ol , whereas there is no tari@@ ff on oil , and only a $ 0.@@ 5 per g@@ all@@ on tax on gas@@ ol@@ ine .
this contra@@ sts with the $ 0.@@ 5@@ 1 per g@@ all@@ on sub@@ sid@@ y that US companies ( a huge por@@ tion of which goes to a single firm ) receive on eth@@ an@@ ol .
thus , foreign produc@@ ers can &apos;t compe@@ te unless their costs are $ 1.@@ 0@@ 5 per g@@ all@@ on lower than those of American produc@@ ers .
the huge subsidies have meant that the US has become the largest produc@@ er of eth@@ an@@ ol in the world .
yet , despite this huge advantage , some foreign firms can still make it in the American market .
Brazi@@ lian su@@ gar @-@ based eth@@ an@@ ol costs far less to produce than American cor@@ n @-@ based eth@@ an@@ ol .
Brazil &apos;s firms are far more efficient than America &apos;s subsi@@ di@@ zed industry , which pu@@ ts more energy into getting subsidies out of Congress than in improving efficiency .
some studies suggest that it requires more energy to produce America &apos;s eth@@ an@@ ol than is con@@ tained in it .
if America elimin@@ ated these un@@ fair trade barriers , it would buy more energy from Brazil and less from the Middle East .
evi@@ d@@ ently , the Bush administration would rather help Middle East oil produc@@ ers , whose interests so often seem at vari@@ ance with those of the US , than Brazil .
of course , the Administration never pu@@ ts it that way ; with an energy policy for@@ ged by the oil companies , ar@@ cher D@@ ani@@ els Mi@@ d@@ land and other eth@@ an@@ ol produc@@ ers are just playing along in a cor@@ rupt system of campaign @-@ contribu@@ tions @-@ for @-@ subsidies .
in the trade talks , America said that it would cut subsidies only if others re@@ ci@@ proc@@ ated by opening their markets .
but , as one developing country minister put it , &quot; O@@ ur farmers can compe@@ te with America &apos;s farmers ; we just can &apos;t compe@@ te with America &apos;s Treasury . &quot; developing countries cannot , and should not , open up their markets fully to America &apos;s agricultural goods unless US subsidies are fully elimin@@ ated .
to compe@@ te on a level playing field would force these countries to subsi@@ di@@ ze their farmers , diver@@ ting s@@ car@@ ce funds that are needed for education , health , and infrastructure .
in other areas of trade , the principle of counter@@ v@@ ail@@ ing du@@ ties has been recognized : when a country im@@ poses a sub@@ sid@@ y , others can impose a tax to off@@ set the un@@ fair advantage given to that country &apos;s produc@@ ers .
if markets are open@@ ed up , countries should be given the right to counter@@ v@@ ail American and European subsidies .
this would be a major step forward in trying to create a fair trade regime that promot@@ es development .
at the on@@ set of the development round , most developing countries wor@@ ried not only that the EU and the US would rene@@ ge on their promises ( which they have in large part ) , but also that the resulting agreement would once again make them worse off .
as a result , much of the developing world is re@@ lie@@ ved that at least this risk has been avoi@@ ded .
still , there was a second risk : that the world would think that the agreement itself had ac@@ compli@@ shed the objectives of a development round set for@@ th at D@@ oh@@ a , with trade negoti@@ ators then turning once again to making the next round as un@@ fair as previous ro@@ unds .
this concern , too , now seems to have been al@@ la@@ yed .
there remains one further concern : America has rus@@ h@@ ed to sign a seri@@ es of bilateral trade agreements that are even more one @-@ sid@@ ed and un@@ fair to developing countries , which may pro@@ mp@@ t Europe and others to do likewise .
this divi@@ de @-@ and @-@ con@@ qu@@ er strategy undermin@@ es the multilateral trade system , which is based on the principle of non @-@ discrimin@@ ation .
countries that sign these agreements get prefer@@ ential treatment over all others .
but developing countries have little to gain and much to lose by sig@@ ning these agreements , which almost never deliver the promised benefits .
indeed , the entire world is the los@@ er if the multilateral trade system is weak@@ ened .
the rest of the world must not embra@@ ce America &apos;s unilater@@ al approach : the multilateral trade system is too preci@@ ous to allow it to be destro@@ yed by a US President who has repe@@ ate@@ dly shown his con@@ temp@@ t for global democracy and multilater@@ alism .
the Demo@@ cracy Par@@ ado@@ x
Paris - E@@ lec@@ tions st@@ ol@@ en in Iran , disp@@ ut@@ ed in Afghanistan , and c@@ ari@@ cat@@ ured in G@@ ab@@ on : recent b@@ all@@ ots in these and many other countries do not so much mark the global advance of democracy as demonstr@@ ate the absence of the rule of law .
of course , elections that lead to illi@@ ber@@ al outcomes , and even to des@@ po@@ ti@@ sm , are not a new phen@@ om@@ en@@ on .
Hit@@ ler , after all , came to power in Germany in 193@@ 3 through a free , fair , and competitive election .
moreover , problemati@@ c elections constitu@@ te a specific challenge for the West , which is si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously the be@@ ar@@ er of a universal democratic message and the cul@@ pri@@ t of an imperi@@ alist past that undermin@@ es that message &apos;s persu@@ asi@@ veness and uti@@ lity .
in a not@@ ed ess@@ ay in 2004 , for example , the Indian @-@ born auth@@ or F@@ are@@ ed Z@@ ak@@ aria descri@@ bed the danger of what he called &quot; illi@@ ber@@ al democracy . &quot;
for Z@@ ak@@ aria , America had to support a moderate leader like General Per@@ vez Musharraf in Pakistan , despite the fact that he had not come to power through an election .
by contrast , Z@@ ak@@ aria argued , Venezuela &apos;s populist president , Hu@@ go ChÃ¡vez , who was legitim@@ ately elected , should be op@@ posed .
in our glob@@ alized world , the potential di@@ vor@@ ce between elections and democracy has assum@@ ed a new di@@ men@@ sion .
with inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ous communic@@ ation and access to information , the less legitimate a regime , the greater will be the temp@@ tation for it to manipul@@ ate , if not f@@ abri@@ c@@ ate , the results of elections .
the &quot; tr@@ end@@ y &quot; way is to manufac@@ ture a significant but not too massive victory . today &apos;s des@@ po@@ ts view near @-@ un@@ anim@@ ous Soviet @-@ style electoral &quot; vict@@ ories &quot; as vul@@ gar and old fas@@ hi@@ oned .
but another new asp@@ ect of this phen@@ om@@ en@@ on are opposition forces that are willing to attempt to neg@@ ate such mach@@ in@@ ations by the party in power .
confron@@ ted with this du@@ al process of il@@ legitimacy , the West often fin@@ ds itself con@@ dem@@ ned to si@@ t between two ch@@ air@@ s , and to face criticism whatever the outcome .
those in power , as in Iran , acc@@ use Western governments of supporting the opposition , and those in opposition acc@@ use the West of supporting the government , as has happened to France in the case of G@@ ab@@ on .
so what lessons should we dra@@ w from the inevit@@ ably mess@@ y nature of electoral proc@@ esses in countries where there is either no middle class or only a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary one , and where a democratic culture is at best in its inf@@ an@@ cy ?
the time has come for the West to re@@ ass@@ ess its policies in a fundamental way .
it cannot s@@ wit@@ ch from &quot; activi@@ sm &quot; at one moment to ab@@ sten@@ tion the next .
a ref@@ us@@ al to act , after all , is also a political choice .
of course , the temp@@ tations of isol@@ ation@@ ism are great , and will increase in the months and years ahead .
but the West has neither the moral right nor a strategic possibility of withdra@@ wing into an &quot; i@@ vor@@ y To@@ wer , &quot; something which in most cases does not exist .
it is impossible to say to Afghanistan , for example , &quot; Y@@ o@@ u have deeply dis@@ appoin@@ ted us , so , from now on , you must cle@@ an up your own m@@ ess . &quot; in Afghanistan , G@@ ab@@ on , Iran , Pakistan , and elsewhere , fundamental Western interests - though very different depen@@ ding on the case - are at stak@@ e .
in Afghanistan , the danger is that a terrorist ha@@ ven could be re@@ constitu@@ ted .
the risk in Iran is an ever more hosti@@ le regime armed with nuclear weapons .
in G@@ ab@@ on , the priority for France is to trans@@ c@@ end ne@@ o @-@ coloni@@ alism without losing its important lin@@ ks to the oil @-@ rich African nation .
but , in pursu@@ it of these difficult objectives , the West must get both its ambi@@ tions and its meth@@ ods right .
democracy is a legitimate objective , but it is a long @-@ term one .
in the medium term , the absence of the rule of law constitu@@ tes the most serious problem for the countries in question .
French tel@@ evi@@ sion , for example , recently ai@@ red a ter@@ ri@@ fying report on Ha@@ it@@ i , where a local ju@@ dge , without bo@@ ther@@ ing to hi@@ de his actions , was protec@@ ting a nar@@ co@@ tics de@@ al@@ er from the country &apos;s own French @-@ tra@@ ined anti @-@ drug force .
corruption e@@ ats away at a society from within , destro@@ ying citizens &quot; trust in a future based on a shared sense of common good .
it is the West &apos;s accept@@ ance of corruption - either open or tac@@ it - that makes it an ac@@ compli@@ ce to too many ne@@ f@@ ari@@ ous regimes , and makes its es@@ po@@ us@@ al of democratic principles appear either hy@@ po@@ critical or contra@@ dic@@ tory .
on the other hand , setting the rule @-@ of @-@ law standard too high will also mis@@ fire .
Singap@@ ore @-@ style inc@@ or@@ rup@@ ti@@ ble one @-@ party state b@@ ent on moderni@@ zing society is probably a far too ambi@@ tious goal for most non @-@ democratic regimes .
the dist@@ ance that separ@@ ates the West from countries that rely on sha@@ m elections is not only geo@@ graphi@@ c , religious , or cultural ; it is ch@@ r@@ on@@ ological . their &quot; time &quot; is not , has never been , or is no longer the same as that of the West .
how can they be understood without being jud@@ ged , or helped without hu@@ mili@@ ating pat@@ ern@@ alism or , still worse , without an un@@ acceptable &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage , &quot; as in Afghanistan ?
the West &apos;s status in tom@@ or@@ row &apos;s world will largely depend upon how it ans@@ wers this question .
it cannot afford to ignor@@ e the issue any longer .
the Demo@@ cra@@ t &apos;s Di@@ se@@ ase
Bu@@ cha@@ rest : &quot; Paris , &quot; Prote@@ st@@ ant K@@ ing H@@ en@@ ri of N@@ av@@ ar@@ re qui@@ pped before as@@ c@@ ending the th@@ r@@ one of C@@ atholi@@ c France , &quot; is worth a mass . &quot;
is EU membership worth the life of Rom@@ ania &apos;s democratic parties , perhaps its inf@@ ant democracy ?
that question will be on the li@@ ps of many of Rom@@ ania &apos;s re@@ form@@ ers and demo@@ crats when going to the poll@@ s next week for general and presidential elections .
Bar@@ on@@ ess E@@ mm@@ a Nich@@ ol@@ son , the European Parliament &apos;s special en@@ vo@@ y to Rom@@ ania , has war@@ ned that unless Rom@@ ania &apos;s next government spe@@ e@@ ds the pace of reform - particularly privati@@ zation of big state companies - hopes of jo@@ ining the EU will collapse .
but our ruling center / right government is mas@@ sively un@@ popular precisely because it tried to meet EU demands .
this un@@ popul@@ ar@@ ity open@@ ed the way for a return to the presidency of I@@ on I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u , the C@@ e@@ aus@@ es@@ c@@ u @-@ era appar@@ at@@ ch@@ i@@ k who ru@@ led Rom@@ ania during the first , wa@@ sted years of our post@@ communist transition .
I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s first term were years that the lo@@ cu@@ sts ate : reform la@@ gg@@ ed behind most Central European countries , corruption fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed , ra@@ bi@@ d nationali@@ sts bark@@ ed , the government called in loy@@ alist th@@ u@@ gs from the min@@ es to be@@ at up people who prote@@ sted .
four years ago , on a high ti@@ de of hope , a center / right coalition and a new &quot; democratic &quot; president - E@@ mi@@ l Con@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u - took power , surpri@@ sing@@ ly defe@@ ating I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u and his party .
Con@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s government promised to close the gap between Rom@@ ania and other post@@ communist countries bi@@ d@@ ding to join the EU .
it promised to cle@@ an up corruption and our banks .
belie@@ ving J@@ acqu@@ es Chira@@ c would deliver on his ple@@ d@@ ges of support , it promised NATO membership .
it promised that , by 2000 , people would be better off .
none of this happened and Rom@@ ani@@ ans feel betra@@ yed .
they are now prepared to he@@ ed I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s si@@ ren s@@ ong that the future can be found only by going back to the past .
are they right ?
was Con@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s presidency a total failure ?
no .
after years of decline , the economy is growing ; after num@@ erous financial sc@@ and@@ als , the banking system is saf@@ er .
privati@@ zation advanced , nationali@@ sts were constra@@ ined , relations with our big Hung@@ arian minority improved , the country stood with the West during the Kosovo war .
none of this , however , made any difference in people &apos;s da@@ i@@ ly lives - indeed , the Kosovo war and sanctions on Serbia kno@@ ck@@ ed 1 @-@ 2 % off Rom@@ ania &apos;s GDP last year .
economic dis@@ satis@@ fac@@ tion , however , does not account for all Rom@@ ania &apos;s fru@@ stra@@ tions .
we also res@@ ent the Con@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u coalition &apos;s internal f@@ eu@@ ding and in@@ comp@@ et@@ ence , what the Ita@@ li@@ ans call &quot; mal@@ govern@@ o . &quot;
from day one , the coalition was ri@@ ven by f@@ eu@@ ds .
ministers acted like ad@@ vers@@ aries rather than partners .
instead of bl@@ am@@ ing I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u for the sh@@ am@@ bles in which he left the country , coalition members bl@@ am@@ ed each other .
such squ@@ ab@@ b@@ ling , it seems , is a post@@ communist mal@@ ad@@ y .
Poland , Hung@@ ary , even Russia : in all three , in@@ fighting among re@@ form@@ ers allowed the political hei@@ r@@ s to the comm@@ uni@@ sts to rec@@ la@@ im power .
Poland and Hung@@ ary &apos;s post@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts re@@ gained power after reform @-@ min@@ ded governments fre@@ ed prices , began privati@@ zation , and encoura@@ ged business .
Russia &apos;s not @-@ so @-@ e@@ x @-@ comm@@ uni@@ sts never assum@@ ed power again , because re@@ form@@ ers were succ@@ ee@@ ded by Vi@@ k@@ tor C@@ her@@ n@@ om@@ y@@ r@@ di@@ n &apos;s in@@ ert government .
this sequ@@ ence is important because the post@@ communist revi@@ val - in Poland and Hung@@ ary at least - came as growth re@@ appeared .
Poland &apos;s and Hung@@ ary &apos;s post@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts could see that reform worked and so , back in power , continued on the free @-@ ish market road , taking credit for the economic growth n@@ ur@@ tured by their ri@@ v@@ als .
even C@@ her@@ n@@ om@@ y@@ r@@ di@@ n &apos;s government did not n@@ ul@@ li@@ fy Russia &apos;s early reforms .
but I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s first government di@@ ther@@ ed on reform ; growth was a dre@@ am when Con@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u became president .
indeed , Rom@@ ania &apos;s re@@ form@@ ers confron@@ ted conditions that the Poli@@ sh , Hung@@ arian , and Russian reform governments had faced when commun@@ ism first collap@@ sed .
although much more could have been ac@@ compli@@ shed during Con@@ t@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s presidency , hard reforms were en@@ acted but , as in Poland and Hung@@ ary half @-@ a @-@ decade ago , growth arri@@ ved too late to save its arch@@ it@@ ects from electoral defeat .
so I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u and his P@@ D@@ S@@ R party are cru@@ is@@ ing toward a c@@ rus@@ h@@ ing victory .
what remains un@@ known is whether they have learned the lesson other post@@ communist parties learned - ie , to keep reform going once growth appears .
or will they turn back the clo@@ ck ?
A@@ dri@@ an N@@ ast@@ ase , the P@@ D@@ S@@ R &apos;s exec@@ utive president and its candidate for prime minister , seems to le@@ an toward reform .
one sign that he actually will institu@@ te reform will be demonstrated by whether or not the P@@ D@@ S@@ R govern@@ s alone or in coalition with a cent@@ ri@@ st / liberal party or with the Hung@@ arian minority party .
for to con@@ vin@@ ce the world that they would continue re@@ forming , Poland and Hung@@ ary &apos;s post@@ comm@@ uni@@ sts formed coalition governments despite winn@@ ing overwhel@@ ming parliamentary maj@@ orities .
N@@ ast@@ ase knows that if he sur@@ ren@@ ders to the popular mo@@ od , raising sal@@ aries dramatically and st@@ all@@ ing privati@@ zation , the economy will be cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed and Rom@@ ania &apos;s ch@@ ances of jo@@ ining the EU dis@@ appear .
whether N@@ ast@@ ase can pursue a sen@@ sible program depends mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ ly on party unity , and here the P@@ D@@ S@@ R is as divided as Con@@ st@@ ant@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s coalition .
un@@ re@@ formed appar@@ at@@ ch@@ i@@ ks sur@@ round I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u ; they will enjo@@ y the pre@@ sti@@ ge of the presidency in any power struggle over policy .
the current campaign shows that x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a for commun@@ ism re@@ tain an al@@ arm@@ ingly po@@ tent appe@@ al .
the only hop@@ eful asp@@ ect in I@@ li@@ es@@ c@@ u &apos;s lo@@ om@@ ing victory is that his opponents succ@@ ee@@ ded - just in time - in promoting growth and this may encourage the post@@ communist to keep looking ahead .
if the P@@ D@@ S@@ R turns back@@ ward , the mal@@ ad@@ y of our democratic re@@ form@@ ers may prove to be f@@ at@@ al , both for Rom@@ ania &apos;s economy and for our hopes of ever jo@@ ining Europe .
the Democratic H@@ op@@ es of Iraq@@ is
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence in Iraq gi@@ ves a ble@@ ak im@@ pression of that country &apos;s prospects .
sec@@ t@@ arian conflict seems to be increasing on a da@@ i@@ ly basis , with mili@@ ti@@ as m@@ ass@@ ac@@ ring hundreds of Sun@@ nis and Shi@@ it@@ es sol@@ ely on the basis of their religious identi@@ ties .
yet it would be a mistake to think that this b@@ loo@@ d@@ lu@@ st represents widespread senti@@ ment among Iraq@@ is .
while neither American nor Iraqi security officials have yet found a way to t@@ ame the mili@@ ti@@ as , the Iraqi public is increasingly dra@@ wn toward a vision of a democratic , non @-@ sec@@ t@@ arian government for the country .
in 2004 and 2006 , I was involved in conduc@@ ting two nation@@ wide public opinion sur@@ ve@@ ys in Iraq .
contra@@ sting the fin@@ dings of these sur@@ ve@@ ys demonstr@@ ates that over the two years when sec@@ t@@ arian violence has increased , Iraq@@ is increasingly view their f@@ ate in a national , rather than commun@@ al , context .
over this period , the number of Iraq@@ is who said that it was &quot; very important &quot; for Iraq to have a democracy increased from 5@@ 9 % to 65 % .
these same Iraq@@ is saw a lin@@ k between an effective democracy and the separ@@ ation of religion and politics , as under a west@@ ern system .
overall , those who respon@@ ded that they &quot; strong@@ ly agree &quot; that &quot; Iraq would be a better place if religion and politics were separ@@ ated &quot; increased from 27 % in 2004 to 4@@ 1 % in 2006 .
particularly significant were increases from 24 % to 6@@ 3 % during this period among Sun@@ nis and from 4@@ 1 % to 65 % among Kur@@ ds .
opinion on this question within the majority Shi@@ i@@ te community remained stable , with 23 % strong@@ ly agre@@ eing in both 2004 and 2006 .
similarly , the surv@@ ey found declining support for an Islamic state .
between 2004 and 2006 , the number of Iraq@@ is who said it was &quot; very good to have an Islamic government where religious leaders have absolute power &quot; fell from 30 % to 22 % .
dec@@ lines occurred in all three leading ethnic communities : from 3@@ 9 % to 35 % among Shi@@ it@@ es , from 20 % to 6 % among Sun@@ nis , and from 11 % to 5 % among Kur@@ ds .
there was some increase in the number of Shi@@ it@@ es who thought that there should be a strong religious el@@ ement in national laws , the majority still op@@ posed this .
nationalist senti@@ ment is also increasing .
asked whether they considered themselves &quot; Iraq@@ is , above all &quot; or &quot; Muslims , above all , &quot; the 2006 surv@@ ey found that 28 % of Iraq@@ is identi@@ fied themselves as &quot; Iraq@@ is , above all , &quot; up from 23 % in 2004 .
in the capital , B@@ ag@@ h@@ da@@ d , the center of so much sec@@ t@@ arian violence , the numbers were even more im@@ pres@@ sive , with the share of the population who saw themselves as &quot; Iraq@@ is , above all &quot; doub@@ ling , from 30 % to 60 % .
by contrast , similar sur@@ ve@@ ys in other Arab capit@@ als find a decided ti@@ lt toward a Muslim identity . in Am@@ man , Jord@@ an , the most recent fig@@ ure is 12 % who put their national identity ahead of their Muslim identity .
the fig@@ ure is 11 % in C@@ air@@ o , Egypt , and 17 % in Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h , Saudi Arabia .
c@@ uri@@ ously , in T@@ ehr@@ an , Iran , the choice is mark@@ edly in favor of Iranian , rather than Muslim , identity .
among re@@ sidents of the Iranian capital , the share of &quot; nationali@@ sts &quot; so@@ ared from 3@@ 8 % in 2000 to 5@@ 9 % in 2005 .
at the same time , Iraqi attitu@@ des show a strong re@@ action to da@@ i@@ ly violence .
between 2004 and 2006 , the propor@@ tion who strong@@ ly agreed that life in Iraq is &quot; un@@ predic@@ table and dangerous &quot; increased from 4@@ 6 % to 5@@ 9 % .
the change was felt in all communities , rising from 4@@ 1 % to 4@@ 8 % among Shi@@ it@@ es , from 7@@ 7 % to 8@@ 4 % among Sun@@ nis , and from 16 % to 50 % among Kur@@ ds .
at the same time , the sur@@ ve@@ ys found little support among any of these three major groups for sec@@ t@@ arian conflict .
the violence has had a major effect on Iraqi attitu@@ des toward for@@ eign@@ ers .
by 2006 , di@@ stru@@ st of Americans , British , and French had reached 90 % , and attitu@@ des toward Iraq &apos;s neighbors were also ten@@ se .
more than half of Iraq@@ is sur@@ ve@@ yed said that they would not wel@@ come Tur@@ ks , Jord@@ ani@@ ans , Ir@@ ani@@ ans , or Ku@@ wa@@ iti@@ s as neighbors .
these fe@@ el@@ ings , it appears , are directly related to the violence gri@@ pp@@ ing Iraq , and the role of for@@ eign@@ ers in the country &apos;s per@@ il@@ ous security situation .
so it appears that Iraq@@ is are sho@@ wing greater att@@ ach@@ ment to their national identity and are suppor@@ tive of a non @-@ sec@@ t@@ arian approach to government .
these are the basic tra@@ its of a modern political order .
among Sun@@ nis , the decline in support for an Islamic state is most dramatic , and may have significant ra@@ mi@@ fic@@ ations for the ability of religious extremi@@ sts to rec@@ ru@@ it among them .
although Iraq@@ is remain an@@ gr@@ y about the violence in their country , this an@@ ger has not undermin@@ ed their sense of national identity .
at the same time , they appear to be holding on@@ to important democratic values .
the key question , of course , remains whether these values can be trans@@ l@@ ated into a peaceful reality .
why India slow@@ ed
new D@@ E@@ L@@ H@@ I - F@@ or a country as poor as India , growth should be what Americans call a &quot; no @-@ bra@@ in@@ er . &quot;
it is largely a matter of providing public goods : dec@@ ent governance , security of life and property , and basic infrastructure like ro@@ ads , bri@@ d@@ ges , ports , and power pl@@ ants , as well as access to education and basic health care .
unlike many equally poor countries , India already has a strong entrep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al class , a reason@@ ably large and well @-@ educ@@ ated middle class , and a number of world @-@ class corpor@@ ations that can be en@@ li@@ sted in the effort to provide these public goods .
why , then , has India &apos;s GDP growth slow@@ ed so much , from nearly 10 % year on year in 2010 @-@ 11 to 5 % today ?
was annual growth of almost 8 % in the decade from 2002 to 2012 an ab@@ er@@ ration ?
I believe that it was not , and that two important factors have come into play in the last two years .
first , India probably was not fully prepared for its rapid growth in the years before the global financial crisis .
for example , new fac@@ t@@ ories and min@@ es require land .
but land is often held by small farmers or in@@ hab@@ ited by tri@@ b@@ al groups , who have neither clear and cle@@ an ti@@ tle nor the information and cap@@ ability to deal on equal terms with a develop@@ er or corporate acqu@@ ir@@ er .
not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , farmers and tri@@ b@@ al groups often felt explo@@ ited as sav@@ v@@ y bu@@ yers purch@@ ased their land for a p@@ it@@ t@@ ance and res@@ old it for a fortun@@ e .
and the compens@@ ation that poor farmers did receive did not go very far ; having sol@@ d their primary means of ear@@ ning income , they then faced a ste@@ ep rise in the local cost of living , owing to development .
in short , strong growth tests economic institutions &quot; capacity to co@@ pe , and India &apos;s were found lac@@ king .
its land ti@@ t@@ ling was frag@@ ment@@ ed , the laws govern@@ ing land ac@@ qui@@ sition were arch@@ ai@@ c , and the process of re@@ z@@ oning land for industrial use was non @-@ transpar@@ ent .
India is a vi@@ br@@ ant democracy , and , as the economic system failed the poor and the weak , the political system tried to compens@@ ate .
unlike in some other developing economies , where the rights of farmers or tri@@ b@@ als have never stood in the way of development , in India politicians and NG@@ Os took up their cause .
land ac@@ qui@@ sition became progres@@ sively more difficult .
a similar story played out elsewhere .
for example , the government &apos;s in@@ ability to alloc@@ ate resources such as min@@ ing rights or wi@@ rel@@ ess spec@@ tru@@ m in a transpar@@ ent way led the cour@@ ts to interven@@ e and demand change .
and , as the bureau@@ cracy go@@ t hau@@ led before the cour@@ ts , it saw limited up@@ side from taking decisions , despite the significant down@@ side from not ac@@ ting .
as the bureau@@ cracy re@@ tre@@ ated from helping businesses n@@ avi@@ gate India &apos;s ple@@ th@@ or@@ a of rules , the required per@@ mis@@ sions and cle@@ ar@@ ances were no longer gran@@ ted .
in su@@ m , because India &apos;s existing economic institutions could not co@@ pe with strong growth , its political ch@@ ec@@ ks and balances started ki@@ cking in to prevent further damage , and growth slow@@ ed .
the second reason for India &apos;s slowdown st@@ ems from the global financial crisis .
many emerging markets that were growing strong@@ ly before the crisis respon@@ ded by in@@ jec@@ ting substantial amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus .
for a while , as industrial countries reco@@ vered in 2010 , this seemed like the right medic@@ ine .
emerging markets around the world enjo@@ yed a spec@@ tac@@ ular recovery .
but , as industrial countries , bes@@ et by fiscal , sovereign @-@ debt , and banking problems , slow@@ ed once again , the fi@@ x for emerging markets turned out to be only temporary .
to off@@ set the collapse in demand from industrial countries , they had stimul@@ ated domestic demand .
but domestic demand did not call for the same goods , and the goods that were lo@@ cally dem@@ anded were already in short supply before the crisis .
the net result was over@@ he@@ ating - asset @-@ price bo@@ oms and inflation across the emerging world .
in India , matters were ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated by the investment slowdown that began as political opposition to un@@ bri@@ d@@ led development emerged .
the resulting supply constra@@ ints exac@@ erb@@ ated inflation .
so , even as growth slow@@ ed , the central bank raised interest rates in order to re@@ balance demand and the available supply , causing the economy to slow further .
to revi@@ ve growth in the short run , India must improve supply , which means shif@@ ting from consumption to investment .
and it must do so by creating new , transpar@@ ent institutions and proc@@ esses , which would limit ad@@ verse political re@@ action .
over the medium term , it must take an a@@ x@@ e to the thi@@ ck@@ et of un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy regulations that make businesses so dependent on an agi@@ le and co@@ oper@@ ative bureau@@ cracy .
one example of a new institution is the C@@ ab@@ in@@ et Committee on Invest@@ ment , which has been created to facilit@@ ate the comple@@ tion of large projects .
by bringing together the key ministers , the commit@@ tee has coordin@@ ated and acceler@@ ated decision @-@ making , and has already appro@@ ved tens of billions of dollars in spending in its first few me@@ et@@ ings .
in addition to more investment , India needs less consumption and higher savings .
the government has taken a first step by ti@@ ghten@@ ing its own budget and spending less , especially on dist@@ or@@ tion@@ ary subsidies .
households also need stronger incentives to increase financial savings .
new fi@@ xed @-@ income instru@@ ments , such as inflation @-@ inde@@ xed bonds , will help .
so will lower inflation , which rais@@ es real returns on bank deposi@@ ts .
lower government spending , together with ti@@ ght monetary policy , are contribu@@ ting to greater price stability .
if all goes well , India &apos;s economy should reco@@ ver and return to its recent 8 % average in the next cou@@ ple of years .
enormous new projects are in the works to sustain this growth .
for example , the plann@@ ed Del@@ hi @-@ M@@ um@@ ba@@ i Industri@@ al Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , a project with Japanese coll@@ abor@@ ation ent@@ ail@@ ing more than $ 90 billion in investment , will lin@@ k Del@@ hi to M@@ um@@ ba@@ i &apos;s ports , co@@ vering an overall l@@ eng@@ th of 1,@@ 4@@ 8@@ 3 kil@@ om@@ e@@ ters ( 9@@ 21 mi@@ les ) and pass@@ ing through six states .
the project includes n@@ ine large industrial z@@ ones , high @-@ spe@@ ed f@@ rei@@ ght lines , three ports , six air@@ ports , a six @-@ lan@@ e ex@@ pres@@ s@@ way , and a 4@@ ,000 @-@ me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t power plant .
we have already seen a significant boost to economic activity from India &apos;s construction of its high@@ way system .
the boost to jobs and growth from the Del@@ hi @-@ M@@ um@@ ba@@ i Industri@@ al Cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , lin@@ king the country &apos;s political and financial capit@@ als , could be significantly greater .
to the extent that democratic respon@@ ses to institutional inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ ity will contribute to stronger and more sustainable growth , India &apos;s economic cl@@ ou@@ ds have a sil@@ ver lin@@ ing .
but if India &apos;s politicians engage in point @-@ s@@ cor@@ ing rather than institution @-@ building , the current slowdown may por@@ tend stor@@ my we@@ a@@ ther ahead .
the Demo@@ cra@@ ti@@ zation of A@@ id
the out@@ po@@ uring of aid in response to the Indian O@@ ce@@ an ts@@ un@@ ami brought hope to a tro@@ ub@@ led world .
in the face of an immen@@ se tra@@ ge@@ dy , working class families around the world open@@ ed their wal@@ le@@ ts to the disaster &apos;s victims .
former US President Bill Clinton called this response a &quot; democra@@ ti@@ zation of development assistance , &quot; in which individuals l@@ end their help not only through their governments but also through their own efforts .
but , while more than 200@@ ,000 people peri@@ shed in the ts@@ un@@ ami disaster , an equivalent number of children die each month of malaria in Africa , a disaster I call a &quot; sil@@ ent ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
Africa &apos;s sil@@ ent ts@@ un@@ ami of malaria , however , is actually largely avoi@@ dable and contro@@ ll@@ able .
malaria can be prev@@ ented to a significant extent , and can be tre@@ ated with nearly 100 % success , through available low @-@ cost technologies .
yet malaria &apos;s African victims , as well as those in other parts of the world , are typically too poor to have access to these life @-@ saving technologies .
a global effort , similar to the response to the Asian ts@@ un@@ ami , could change this disa@@ stro@@ us situation , saving more than one million lives per year .
her@@ ein lies the main message of the new report of the UN Millenni@@ um Pro@@ ject , which was deli@@ vered in mid @-@ January to UN Secretary General K@@ of@@ i Ann@@ an .
the Pro@@ ject , which I direct on be@@ half of the Secretary General , represents an effort by more than 2@@ 50 scientists and development experts to identi@@ fy practi@@ cal means to achieve the Millenni@@ um Development Go@@ als to cut extreme poverty , disease , and h@@ unger by the year 2015 .
our new report , enti@@ t@@ led Invest@@ ing in Development : a Pra@@ cti@@ cal Plan to A@@ chie@@ ve the Millenni@@ um Development Go@@ als ( available for down@@ lo@@ ad at w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ un@@ mi@@ ll@@ en@@ ni@@ um@@ pro@@ jec@@ t@@ .@@ or@@ g ) , shows that these goals can be achieved .
the key to meeting the Millenni@@ um Development Go@@ als in poor countries is an increase in investment in people ( health , education , nut@@ ri@@ tion , and family plann@@ ing ) , the environment ( water and san@@ it@@ ation , so@@ ils , fore@@ sts , and bio@@ diversi@@ ty ) , and infrastructure ( ro@@ ads , power , and ports ) .
poor countries cannot afford these investments on their own , so rich countries must help .
if more financial aid is combined with good governance in poor countries , then the Millenni@@ um Development Go@@ als can be achieved on time .
in short , our new Re@@ port is a call to action .
rich countries and poor countries need to join forces to cut poverty , disease , and h@@ unger .
the reason that the Millenni@@ um Development Go@@ als are fe@@ a@@ sible is that powerful existing technologies give us the tools to make rapid adv@@ ances in the quality of life and economic productivity of the world &apos;s poor .
ill@@ ness and deaths from malaria can be reduced sharply by using in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide @-@ tre@@ ated bed n@@ ets to stop the mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es that trans@@ mit malaria , and by effective medic@@ ines when the ill@@ ness stri@@ kes .
the total cost of batt@@ ling malaria in Africa would be around $ 2 to $ 3 billion per year .
with around one billion people living in high @-@ income countries , it would thus cost just $ 2 to $ 3 per person per year in the developed world to fund an effort that could save more than one million children annually .
when child mor@@ ta@@ lity is reduced , poor families choose to have fewer children , because they are more confi@@ dent that their children will survi@@ ve to ad@@ ul@@ tho@@ od .
thus , parado@@ xi@@ cally , saving children &apos;s lives is part of the solution to rapid population growth in poor countries .
malaria is an important example where specific investments can solve the problems of disease , h@@ unger , and extreme poverty .
our report makes do@@ zens of such practi@@ cal re@@ commen@@ d@@ ations .
investments in so@@ il nut@@ ri@@ ents and water har@@ v@@ est@@ ing could help African farmers double or tri@@ ple their food yi@@ elds .
anti @-@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral medic@@ ines can help save millions from death due to AIDS .
rural ro@@ ads , tru@@ ck tran@@ sport , and electricity could bring new economic opportunities to remo@@ te vil@@ la@@ ges in Latin America , Africa , and Asia .
school me@@ al programs using lo@@ cally produced food could boost atten@@ d@@ ance by poor children , especially gir@@ ls , and improve their ability to learn , while also providing an exp@@ anded market for local farmers .
these investments are an incre@@ di@@ ble bar@@ gain .
rich countries have long promised to increase their aid levels to 0.@@ 7 % of national income ( from around only 0.@@ 25 % today ) .
the promise of 0.@@ 7 % means that the rich world would give developing countries a m@@ ere 70 c@@ ents out of each $ 100 of national income .
in recent weeks , many European countries have ple@@ dged to hon@@ or the 0.@@ 7 % commitment , and five European countries ( Den@@ mark , Lu@@ x@@ em@@ bo@@ ur@@ g , the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , Nor@@ way , and S@@ weden ) already do so .
it &apos;s up to the US and Japan to follow through on their promises as well .
moreover , with the &quot; democra@@ ti@@ zation &quot; of aid now under@@ way , we can look forward to increased private efforts al@@ ong@@ side official development assistance .
of course , not all developing countries are suffici@@ ently well govern@@ ed to use an increase in aid in an hon@@ est , effective way .
the world should therefore start this b@@ old effort by foc@@ using on the poor countries that are relatively well govern@@ ed and that are prepared to carry out needed investments in an efficient and fair man@@ ner .
G@@ han@@ a , Sen@@ egal , T@@ anz@@ ania , Ken@@ ya , and E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia are on that list .
it is urg@@ ent that we get started in these and similarly well govern@@ ed poor countries this year .
the Democrats &quot; L@@ ine in the S@@ and
Ber@@ kel@@ ey - E@@ ver since the 19@@ 28 work of Fr@@ ank R@@ am@@ se@@ y , economists have accepted the uti@@ lit@@ arian argument that a good economy is one in which returns on investment are not too great a multi@@ ple - less than three - of the rate of per capita economic growth .
an economy in which profits from investment are high relative to the growth rate is an economy that is under @-@ saving and under @-@ invest@@ ing .
this idea has also given rise to a very strong pre@@ su@@ mption that if an economy as a whole is under @-@ saving and under @-@ invest@@ ing , the government ought to help to correc@@ t this problem by running sur@@ pl@@ uses , not make it worse by running deficits that dra@@ in the po@@ ol of private savings available to fund investment .
this is why most economists are deficit ha@@ w@@ ks .
of course , governments need to run deficits in de@@ pres@@ sions in order to stimul@@ ate demand and stem rising unemployment .
moreover , a lot of emer@@ gency government spending on current it@@ ems is really best seen as national savings and investment .
Frank@@ lin Del@@ an@@ o Ro@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ elt could have made no better investment for the future of America and the world than to wage total war against Ad@@ ol@@ f Hit@@ ler .
likewise , Pre@@ sidents George H@@ .@@ W. Bush and Bill Clinton ought to have recognized in the 1990 &quot; s that something like a Mar@@ sh@@ all Plan for Eastern Europe to help with the transition from commun@@ ism would have been an exc@@ ell@@ ent investment for the world &apos;s future .
but the rule is that governments should run sur@@ pl@@ uses and not deficits , so various American pre@@ sidents &quot; economic ad@@ vis@@ ers have been advoc@@ ates of aim@@ ing for budget sur@@ pl@@ uses exc@@ ept in times of sl@@ ack demand and threat@@ ening de@@ pression .
this was certainly true of Eis@@ en@@ ho@@ wer &apos;s , Ni@@ xon &apos;s , and For@@ d &apos;s economic ad@@ vis@@ ors , and of George H@@ .@@ W. Bush &apos;s and Bill Clinton &apos;s economic ad@@ vis@@ ers .
it was true of Reagan &apos;s economic ad@@ vis@@ ers as well .
some of Reagan &apos;s ad@@ vis@@ ers sin@@ cer@@ ely did not believe that the tax cuts of the early 1980 &quot; s would generate the large deficits that they did ( Ber@@ y@@ l S@@ prin@@ k@@ el and L@@ aw@@ ren@@ ce Ku@@ d@@ low come to mind ) .
others , like Mar@@ tin F@@ el@@ d@@ st@@ ein and M@@ ur@@ ra@@ y Wei@@ den@@ b@@ au@@ m , understood the consequences of the Reagan tax cuts and were bit@@ ter bureau@@ cratic opponents , even if they did not spe@@ ak out public@@ ly .
in fact , since W@@ W@@ II , only George W. Bush &apos;s economic ad@@ vis@@ ers have bro@@ ken with this consensus .
a few have done so because they are making care@@ ers as party @-@ line Republi@@ cans , so their priority is to tell Republican politicians what they want to he@@ ar ( Jo@@ sh B@@ ol@@ ton and Mit@@ ch D@@ ani@@ els come to mind here ) .
as for the rest , their reasons for supporting the Bush administration &apos;s savings @-@ dra@@ ining policies remain my@@ st@@ eri@@ ous .
it is not as though they were ang@@ ling for li@@ fe@@ time W@@ hi@@ te House c@@ af@@ e@@ teri@@ a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ges , or that having said &quot; yes &quot; to George W. Bush will open any do@@ ors for them in the future .
but their fail@@ ings do pose a di@@ lemma for Democratic deficit @-@ ha@@ w@@ k economists trying to determine what good economic policies would be should Barack Obama become president .
those of us who served in the Clinton administration and worked hard to put America &apos;s finan@@ ces in order and turn deficits into sur@@ pl@@ uses are ke@@ en@@ ly aw@@ are that , after eight years of the George W. Bush administration , things look worse than when we started back in 199@@ 3 .
all of our work was und@@ one by our success@@ ors in their qu@@ est to win the class war by making America &apos;s income distribution more un@@ equal .
a cha@@ in is only as strong as its weak@@ est lin@@ k , and it seems poin@@ t@@ less to work to strengthen the Democratic lin@@ ks of the cha@@ in of fiscal ad@@ vice when the Republican lin@@ ks are not just weak but ab@@ sent .
political ad@@ vis@@ ers to future Democratic administ@@ ra@@ tions may argue that the only way to ti@@ e the Republi@@ cans &quot; hands and keep them from laun@@ ching another wealth @-@ pol@@ ari@@ zing offen@@ sive is to wi@@ den the deficit enough that even they are sc@@ ared of it .
they might be right .
the surplus @-@ creating fiscal policies established by Robert Ru@@ bin and company in the Clinton administration would have been very good for America had the Clinton administration been followed by a normal success@@ or .
but what is the right fiscal policy for a future Democratic administration to follow when there is no guarantee that any Republican success@@ ors will ever be &quot; normal &quot; again ?
that &apos;s a hard question , and I don &apos;t know the answer .
there is , however , one fiscal principle that must be resp@@ ected .
fiscal deficits so large that they put the debt @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio on an explo@@ sive up@@ ward trend do not merely act as a dra@@ g on long @-@ term economic growth ; they also create the possibility that at any moment the economy might face an immediate macroeconomic and financial disaster .
a more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish fiscal stance may no longer be possible in future Democratic administ@@ ra@@ tions , and might not be good policy if it were , given the likely comple@@ xi@@ on of success@@ or administ@@ ra@@ tions .
stabili@@ zing the debt @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio is thus the line in the s@@ and that must not be cro@@ s@@ sed .
America &apos;s B@@ lin@@ ders
Singap@@ ore - The time has come to think the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able : the era of American domin@@ ance in international affairs may well be coming to an end .
as that moment appro@@ aches , the main question will be how well the United States is prepared for it .
Asia &apos;s rise over the last few decades is more than a story of rapid economic growth .
it is the story of a region under@@ going a ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance in which people &apos;s min@@ ds are re @-@ open@@ ed and their out@@ look re@@ fre@@ shed .
Asia &apos;s movement toward resu@@ ming its former central role in the global economy has so much moment@@ um that it is virtually un@@ stopp@@ able .
while the trans@@ formation may not always be se@@ am@@ less , there is no longer room to doubt that an Asian century is on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on , and that the world &apos;s chemi@@ stry will change fundament@@ ally .
global leaders - whether policymakers or intellec@@ tu@@ als - bear a responsibility to pre@@ p@@ are their societies for im@@ pen@@ ding global shif@@ ts .
but too many American leaders are shi@@ r@@ king this responsibility .
last year , at the World Economic Forum in D@@ avo@@ s , two US sen@@ ators , one member of the US House of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives , and a dep@@ ut@@ y national security ad@@ vis@@ er particip@@ ated in a for@@ um on the future of American power ( I was the ch@@ air ) .
when asked what future they anti@@ cip@@ ated for American power , they predic@@ t@@ ably declared that the US would remain the world &apos;s most powerful country .
when asked whether America was prepared to become the world &apos;s second @-@ largest economy , they were reti@@ cent .
their re@@ action was under@@ stand@@ able : even enter@@ taining the possibility of the US becoming &quot; number two &quot; amounts to care@@ er su@@ i@@ cide for an American politici@@ an .
elected officials everywhere must ad@@ just , to v@@ ar@@ ying degre@@ es , to fulfi@@ ll the expectations of those who put them in office .
intellec@@ tu@@ als , on the other hand , have a special oblig@@ ation to think the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able and spe@@ ak the un@@ speak@@ able .
they are supposed to consider all pos@@ sibi@@ lities , even dis@@ agre@@ e@@ able ones , and pre@@ p@@ are the population for prospec@@ tive developments .
hon@@ est discussion of un@@ popular ideas is a key feat@@ ure of an open society .
but , in the US , many intellec@@ tu@@ als are not fulfi@@ lling this oblig@@ ation .
Rich@@ ard Ha@@ ass , the president of the Council on For@@ eign R@@ el@@ ations , suggest@@ ed recently that the US &quot; could already be in the second decade of another American century . &quot;
likewise , C@@ l@@ y@@ de Pre@@ sto@@ wi@@ tz , the president of the Economic Str@@ ate@@ gy Institute , has said that &quot; this century may well wind up being another American century . &quot;
to be sure , such predic@@ tions may well prove ac@@ cur@@ ate ; if they do , the rest of the world will benefit .
a strong and dynamic US economy , rein@@ vi@@ gor@@ ated by che@@ ap sh@@ ale gas and acceler@@ ating innovation , would re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ate the global economy as a whole .
but Americans are more than ready for this outcome ; no pre@@ par@@ ation is needed .
if the world &apos;s center of gra@@ v@@ ity shif@@ ts to Asia , however , Americans will be wo@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly un@@ prepared .
many Americans remain sho@@ ck@@ ingly un@@ aw@@ are of how much the rest of the world , especially Asia , has progres@@ sed .
Americans need to be told a simple , ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal truth .
with 3 % of the world &apos;s population , the US can no longer domin@@ ate the rest of the world , because Asi@@ ans , with 60 % of the world &apos;s population , are no longer under@@ per@@ forming .
but the belief that America is the only vir@@ tu@@ ous country , the sol@@ e be@@ ac@@ on of light in a dar@@ k and un@@ stable world , continues to shape many Americans &quot; world@@ view .
American intellec@@ tu@@ als &quot; failure to challenge these ideas - and to help the US population shed com@@ plac@@ ent attitu@@ des based on ignor@@ ance - per@@ pet@@ u@@ ates a culture of co@@ dd@@ ling the public .
but , while Americans tend to receive only good news , Asia &apos;s rise is not really bad news .
the US should recognize that Asian countries are seeking not to domin@@ ate the West , but to em@@ ul@@ ate it .
they seek to build strong and dynamic middle cl@@ asses and to achieve the kind of peace , stability , and prosperity that the West has long enjo@@ yed .
this deep social and intellectual trans@@ formation under@@ way in Asia promises to cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t it from economic power to global leadership .
China , which remains a closed society in many ways , has an open mind , whereas the US is an open society with a closed mind .
with Asia &apos;s middle class set to sk@@ y@@ ro@@ ck@@ et from roughly 500 million people today to 1.@@ 75 billion by 2020 , the US will not be able to avoid the global economy &apos;s new reali@@ ties for much longer .
the world is po@@ is@@ ed to under@@ go one of the most dramatic power shif@@ ts in human history .
in order to be prepared for the trans@@ formation , Americans must aband@@ on ing@@ ra@@ ined ideas and old assu@@ mp@@ tions , and liber@@ ate un@@ thin@@ k@@ able th@@ ou@@ ghts .
that is the challenge facing American public intellec@@ tu@@ als today .
the Den@@ i@@ al of C@@ a@@ ste
de@@ construction as an intellectual de@@ vice has played ha@@ vo@@ c in universities across the West .
now it is c@@ ast@@ ing its sp@@ ell over developing countries , making a powerful play to re@@ wri@@ te India &apos;s past , as De@@ ep@@ ak L@@ al suggests .
India &apos;s an@@ ci@@ ent and medi@@ ev@@ al history is not@@ ori@@ ously m@@ alle@@ able .
the country &apos;s Hin@@ d@@ u nationali@@ sts un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed the latest f@@ uro@@ r over the nature of India &apos;s past .
they re@@ ject the widely accepted view , based on early s@@ ac@@ red tex@@ ts , that an@@ ci@@ ent belie@@ vers did not ban the s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter of c@@ att@@ le , and that such a ban probably became part of the Hin@@ d@@ u moral co@@ de only around the fif@@ th and si@@ x@@ th cent@@ uries A@@ D , when the later P@@ ur@@ an@@ as were w@@ ritten .
the trou@@ ble with reaching defini@@ tive conclu@@ sions about this or any other con@@ te@@ sted asp@@ ect of India &apos;s dist@@ ant past is that , unlike in neighbor@@ ing China , there is little in the way of an objective historical record to rely upon .
some arch@@ ae@@ ological evidence exi@@ sts .
but the main sources for an@@ ci@@ ent India are or@@ ally trans@@ mit@@ ted liter@@ ary accounts d@@ ating to the R@@ ig@@ ve@@ da ( around 1@@ 500 @-@ 1@@ 300 B@@ C ) and the sub@@ jec@@ tive recor@@ ds of foreign tra@@ vel@@ ers .
the social history of an@@ ci@@ ent India , as one sch@@ ol@@ ar ad@@ mi@@ ts , &quot; appears to be a str@@ ing of con@@ jec@@ tures and specul@@ ations . &quot;
so it is hardly surpri@@ sing that India &apos;s an@@ ci@@ ent past can be manipul@@ ated to fit alternative ide@@ ological pre@@ conc@@ ep@@ tions .
no@@ where is this more evi@@ dent than in discus@@ sions about the ori@@ g@@ ins and nature of India &apos;s ca@@ ste system .
in the early 1980 &apos;s , the pre@@ domin@@ ant view on the Le@@ ft was that the an@@ ci@@ ent Hin@@ d@@ u ca@@ ste system was a vari@@ ant of European f@@ eu@@ da@@ li@@ sm .
the late A@@ sho@@ k Ru@@ dr@@ a , himself a man of the Le@@ ft but an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ ci@@ st , provided the most co@@ g@@ ent criti@@ que of this view .
he poin@@ ted out a crucial difference between the conc@@ ep@@ tions of mu@@ tual social ties in the Hin@@ d@@ u and European systems .
where individuals were the central actors in the characteri@@ stic ri@@ tu@@ als of domin@@ ance and hom@@ age in European f@@ eu@@ da@@ li@@ sm , in Hin@@ d@@ u society the relation@@ ships were always defined in terms of ca@@ ste groups .
Ru@@ dr@@ a assum@@ ed that ca@@ ste exist@@ ed in an@@ ci@@ ent India because , despite the un@@ reli@@ able historical record , the ca@@ ste system is so mani@@ fest even today .
but recent histori@@ ans on the Le@@ ft in India now question this assu@@ mption .
a school of revi@@ sion@@ ist histori@@ ans and an@@ thro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts argue that ca@@ ste is an inv@@ en@@ tion of the coloni@@ al British Ra@@ j .
they claim that the early British sch@@ ol@@ ars and ad@@ mini@@ str@@ ators who do@@ cum@@ ented Indian cust@@ oms and trans@@ l@@ ated the early s@@ ac@@ red tex@@ ts were b@@ am@@ boo@@ z@@ led by the Bra@@ h@@ min@@ s@@ --@@ the first Indi@@ ans to learn Engli@@ sh and thus the only available inter@@ medi@@ ari@@ es@@ --@@ into belie@@ ving that the Hin@@ d@@ u social order was ca@@ ste @-@ based .
this imag@@ ined order became reality when British cen@@ sus ta@@ kers forced Indi@@ ans to c@@ ateg@@ ori@@ ze themselves by ca@@ ste .
before this , these histori@@ ans argue , Hin@@ du@@ s were alle@@ ge@@ dly no less individu@@ ali@@ stic than Europeans .
even hi@@ ther@@ to sen@@ sible an@@ thro@@ po@@ logi@@ sts and social histori@@ ans seem to have succ@@ um@@ bed to this tra@@ v@@ est@@ y of sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship .
much of the supposed evidence that this so @-@ called &quot; Su@@ bal@@ tern &quot; school of histori@@ ans provides takes the form of con@@ temporary an@@ thro@@ po@@ logi@@ cal studies of regions like southern India or parts of medi@@ ev@@ al central India .
but , as S@@ us@@ an B@@ ay@@ le@@ y , a &quot; Su@@ bal@@ tern &quot; conver@@ t , pu@@ ts it , &quot; the ini@@ tial pre@@ mise is that even in parts of the Hin@@ d@@ u he@@ ar@@ t@@ land of G@@ ange@@ tic up@@ per India , the institutions and belie@@ fs which are often descri@@ bed as the el@@ ements of traditional ca@@ ste were only taking shape as recently as the early 18 th century . &quot;
I can person@@ ally dis@@ prove this pre@@ mise .
while visi@@ ting K@@ er@@ ala in the late 19@@ 60 &apos;s , I@@ --@@ a Hin@@ d@@ u from the G@@ ange@@ tic he@@ ar@@ t@@ land@@ --@@ went to the S@@ ri P@@ ad@@ man@@ ab@@ h@@ as@@ w@@ am@@ y temp@@ le in Tri@@ v@@ and@@ rum , where the usual &quot; pan@@ das &quot; ac@@ co@@ sted me .
one asked where I came from and asked about my j@@ at@@ i and got@@ ra .
when I ans@@ wer@@ ed , he r@@ att@@ led off the nam@@ es of at least six gener@@ ations of my anc@@ est@@ ors , while as@@ king me to fi@@ ll in the deta@@ ils about my cou@@ sin@@ s , the family into which I had mar@@ ried , and the nam@@ es of our children .
he did not ask for money ; he was only interest@@ ed in up@@ d@@ ating his recor@@ ds .
unless he had imag@@ ined my anc@@ est@@ ors , he had just tra@@ ced my ca@@ ste @-@ based past to well before the 17 th century .
asi@@ de from such exam@@ ples , an economic ration@@ ale can also be provided for the ori@@ g@@ ins of the Indian ca@@ ste system as for European f@@ eu@@ da@@ li@@ sm .
the great E@@ u@@ ra@@ sian civili@@ zations were all dependent on agri@@ culture and needed to create institutional means of t@@ ying labor , which was then s@@ car@@ ce , to the land , which was ab@@ und@@ ant .
ser@@ f@@ dom , in@@ d@@ ent@@ ure , sla@@ very , and the ca@@ ste system all served this end .
how did an@@ ci@@ ent Indian prin@@ ces ti@@ e labor to the land if neither f@@ eu@@ da@@ li@@ sm nor ca@@ ste exist@@ ed ?
even if we are forced , f@@ au@@ te de mi@@ eu@@ x , to specul@@ ate about an@@ ci@@ ent Indian social life , we must remain true to the common fac@@ ts of economic and military life among European and Asian civili@@ zations , which imposed similar institutional respon@@ ses .
these ca@@ ve@@ ats , however , will no doubt leave the revi@@ si@@ oni@@ sts un@@ mo@@ ved , for they are part of the &quot; de@@ con@@ struc@@ tion@@ ist &quot; movement that has deeply influ@@ enced the hum@@ ani@@ ties in American and British universities .
Dec@@ on@@ struc@@ tion@@ i@@ sts do not believe that any sett@@ led &quot; fac@@ ts &quot; exist .
if they are right , there is no difference between the intellectual discipl@@ ine of history , found@@ ed by the Gre@@ eks 2@@ 4@@ 00 years ago to record the past tru@@ th@@ fully , and the my@@ ths that every culture t@@ ells to af@@ firm its self @-@ worth .
without history , we will be ex@@ posed to the full force of the tal@@ es of our imag@@ ined pa@@ sts , which only mi@@ r@@ ror our current h@@ ates and lo@@ ves .
the de@@ population of Europe
by common con@@ sent , the recent EU summit at S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m was a dul@@ l af@@ fair .
EU leaders made some progress on creating a single financial market throughout the Union , and on establishing a standard European pat@@ ent .
other proposals for economic liber@@ alis@@ ation , were de@@ ad@@ lock@@ ed .
the idea of a single European air tra@@ ffi@@ c control area was block@@ ed because of a disp@@ ute between Britain and Spain over Gi@@ br@@ al@@ t@@ ar ; proposals for liber@@ alis@@ ation of gas and electricity supply were resist@@ ed by France , which promot@@ es the public service advanta@@ ges of public sector uti@@ lities .
there was good news , however , in that the S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m summit wi@@ tn@@ essed the first signs that the EU may at last be cre@@ eping , cra@@ b @-@ wise , toward an idea hi@@ ther@@ to t@@ abo@@ o : that the European Union may require an immigration policy .
until recently , member governments held two ideas on immigration : they all took the view that ordinary immigration must be restric@@ ted or prev@@ ented ; they all agreed that asy@@ l@@ um @-@ se@@ ek@@ ers be vili@@ fied as &quot; bo@@ gu@@ s &quot; economic migrants and deter@@ red through policies of har@@ ass@@ ment , in@@ timi@@ d@@ ation and - in some cases - de@@ ten@@ tion .
in addition , some member governments , like those of Germany and Au@@ stri@@ a , have demonstrated serious an@@ xi@@ ety that EU en@@ lar@@ gement will inci@@ te a flo@@ od of job @-@ se@@ ek@@ ers from Central and Eastern Europe , and made clear that they will demand a long del@@ ay in gran@@ ting free movement of lab@@ our to any new member state .
ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en months ago , at the T@@ amp@@ ere summit , EU leaders said that they recogni@@ sed &quot; the need for more efficient management of migration flows . &quot;
what they really meant , however , was stronger measures to t@@ ack@@ le illegal immigration .
S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m came one step closer to ad@@ mit@@ ting Europe &apos;s real population problem , when it spo@@ ke of &quot; the demographi@@ c challenge of an ag@@ eing population of which people of working age constitu@@ te an ever @-@ smaller part . &quot;
indeed , the summit comm@@ uni@@ que said that &quot; an in @-@ dep@@ th discussion of immigration , migration and asy@@ l@@ um &quot; would take place at the EU summit at the end of this year .
but EU leaders have yet to ad@@ mit what every@@ body knows : that Europe &apos;s population is not just ag@@ eing , it is starting to decline , and is likely to decline ste@@ ep@@ ly in coming decades .
at the S@@ to@@ ck@@ hol@@ m summit the leaders pre@@ ten@@ ded that the solution to Europe &apos;s ag@@ eing problem will be found in better job mo@@ bility , more flexi@@ bility , and further economic reform .
the pla@@ in fact , however , is that Europe &apos;s population decline can only be st@@ em@@ med by substantial in@@ ward immigration .
last month ( Febru@@ ary 2001 ) the United Nations publi@@ shed its latest forec@@ a@@ sts for world population over the next 50 years .
the broad pi@@ c@@ ture is that the population of the world &apos;s less developed regions is expected to rise from 4.@@ 9 billion today to 8@@ .@@ 2 billion in 2050 , whereas the population of the developed regions will , in aggregate , remain roughly stable at 1.@@ 2 billion .
within the developed world , however , Europe &apos;s population is expected to decline mark@@ edly .
in some European countries , like France and Ireland , the population will actually rise . but in others there will be ste@@ ep falls .
the population of Germany will decline from 8@@ 2@@ m to just under 7@@ 1@@ m , that of Italy from 5@@ 7@@ .@@ 5@@ m to 4@@ 3@@ m , and that of Spain from nearly 4@@ 0@@ m to just over 3@@ 1@@ m . &quot; all in all , the population of the EU 15 will decline from 3@@ 7@@ 6@@ m to 3@@ 3@@ 9@@ .@@ 3@@ m , a fall of 3@@ 7@@ m or 10 % .
even shar@@ per dec@@ lines are expected in the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe , from a total of 10@@ 5@@ m to 8@@ 5@@ m , a fall of 20@@ m , or about 20 % .
the implications are far @-@ reaching .
first , on a medium @-@ term time @-@ scale , the EU needs substantial immigrants .
second , the fear of a ti@@ d@@ al wa@@ ve of immigrants from Eastern Europe is largely a populist f@@ ant@@ as@@ y .
third , Eastern Europe will itself need substantial immigration .
two strategic foot@@ not@@ es need to be added to this scenario .
first , Turkey &apos;s population is likely to rise hu@@ g@@ ely in the next 50 years , from 6@@ 6@@ m to nearly 10@@ 0@@ m .
now , Turkey has in principle been accepted as a potential candidate for EU membership .
but if UN pro@@ jec@@ tions are correc@@ t , Turkey &apos;s population in 2050 would be far larger than any other member state , including Germany , and would represent nearly 20 % of the population of the en@@ larg@@ ed EU .
the increase in Turkey &apos;s population might almost balance out the decline in the population of the present EU 15 ; but it is unlikely that today &apos;s existing member states will regard this satis@@ fac@@ tory .
moreover , the strategic balance to Europe &apos;s e@@ ast will also be trans@@ formed , because the populations of Russia and the Ukraine are expected to decline even more ste@@ ep@@ ly than those of the EU .
Russia &apos;s population , currently 1@@ 4@@ 5@@ .@@ 5@@ m , is expected to fall to 10@@ 4.@@ 5@@ m ; Ukraine &apos;s population is pro@@ jected to fall from nearly 5@@ 0@@ m to 3@@ 0@@ m , a star@@ t@@ ling drop of 40 % .
this regional pattern , of population decline in Europe , Russia and Ukraine , needs to be set against the larger pi@@ c@@ ture of a 3 billion increase glob@@ ally , mainly in the developing world .
it is difficult to avoid the implic@@ ation that Europe &apos;s need for immigrants is likely to com@@ b@@ ine with massive , and probably ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ ble , migr@@ atory pressure from developing countries to the developed world .
what is now required is that EU leaders stop pre@@ ten@@ ding that Europe &apos;s demographi@@ c ag@@ eing can be sol@@ ved by more internal labor mo@@ bility .
the EU will , instead , need a large , managed immigration policy .
this is , und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , a difficult demand to make of politicians , particularly given the leg@@ acy of x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ c politics in so many member states .
but it must be done , and soon .
the De@@ val@@ uation Del@@ u@@ sion Re@@ visi@@ ted
&quot; the dollar is our currency and your problem . &quot;
so America &apos;s Treasury Secretary qui@@ pped before President Ni@@ xon pul@@ led the plu@@ g on the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods system three decades ago .
what John Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly &apos;s bl@@ un@@ tn@@ ess reflected was America &apos;s abi@@ lit@@ y@@ --@@ and will@@ ing@@ n@@ ess@@ --@@ to export its economic problems by driving down the dollar &apos;s value while sc@@ ap@@ e@@ go@@ ating countries op@@ posed to that strategy .
President George W. Bush seems hel@@ l @-@ b@@ ent on repe@@ ating Ni@@ xon &apos;s mis@@ beg@@ ot@@ ten policy .
like the Ni@@ xon / Con@@ n@@ ol@@ ly team , the Bush administration is respon@@ ding to America &apos;s massive budget and trade deficits by let@@ ting the dollar fall@@ --@@ and hard --@@ while it also tries to di@@ stra@@ c@@ t attention from its responsibility by poin@@ ting an acc@@ using f@@ ing@@ er at China as the cause for both US j@@ ob@@ less@@ ness and de@@ flationary pres@@ sures .
this strategy , however , is likely to prove as ine@@ ff@@ ective now as it was for Ni@@ xon , who succ@@ ee@@ ded only in us@@ her@@ ing in an era of stag@@ nation .
Bush &apos;s policy is do@@ om@@ ed to fail because , as in the 1970 &apos;s , America &apos;s economic problems are hom@@ e@@ grown .
they are not impor@@ ted and cannot be fi@@ xed merely by changing the dollar &apos;s value .
the world &apos;s reli@@ ance on the US as the one source of growth in global demand bu@@ t@@ t@@ res@@ ses America &apos;s currency power play , but at the cost of ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ating vast global imbalances .
since 2000 , America &apos;s excess productive capacity has out@@ stri@@ pped the Euro area and Japan combined , its economy growing far more slow@@ ly than its 3.@@ 5 % to 4 % annual potential , with US unemployment rising .
this pi@@ ti@@ ful performance inc@@ it@@ es an@@ gr@@ y cri@@ es that American jobs are dis@@ appe@@ aring abroad , and that low @-@ cost exports may result in deflation .
s@@ adly , America is not alone in vie@@ wing de@@ val@@ uation as a pan@@ ac@@ e@@ a for domestic problems .
too timi@@ d to under@@ take serious reforms at home , Japanese authorities fight to keep the y@@ en &apos;s value as low as possible against the dollar and ri@@ val Asian currencies .
similarly , the European Union created the euro to give its members increased currency stability .
when the euro was down , wo@@ und@@ ed pri@@ de forced EU governments to try tal@@ king it up .
now that the euro is up , those same governments are trying to talk it down .
the euro &apos;s di@@ zz@@ ying trade @-@ wei@@ gh@@ ted as@@ cent over the past year is , indeed , exac@@ erb@@ ating near @-@ term pres@@ sures within the EU .
but the Union &apos;s finance ministers would be better off push@@ ing the internal reforms Europe needs , rather than following the Bush example and pressing the European Central Bank to force a strong currency down to ear@@ th .
yet America &apos;s currency strategy is the most reck@@ less@@ --@@ another mi@@ gh@@ ty er@@ ror in an economic policy so wa@@ y@@ ward that it is hard to know where to begin li@@ sting the mistak@@ es .
perhaps the best place to start is with the spe@@ ed@@ y de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation in America &apos;s federal budget in the past two years .
from a surplus of 1.@@ 4 % of GDP in 2000 , the Bush administration has deli@@ vered a deficit of 4.@@ 6 % of GDP this year .
US budget deficits may have sp@@ ared America and the world economy even worse per@@ for@@ man@@ ces over the past two years , but fi@@ x@@ ing what ails the US is now far more difficult .
ti@@ ghten@@ ing fiscal policy would go a long way towards boo@@ sting confidence in the US .
it might also help push the rest of the world into moving away from its reli@@ ance on America as the sol@@ e eng@@ ine of growth .
growth elsewhere might help America export more .
but this won &apos;t provide the qui@@ ck fi@@ x that the Bush administration ye@@ ar@@ ns for , because a declining dollar need not bring about an equivalent rise in the price of US imports .
this is partly because the final price of an impor@@ ted good reflects num@@ erous costs such as distribution and mark@@ eting , which are un@@ affected by the exchange rate .
indeed , many countries that export to the US@@ --@@ especially Japan and Chin@@ a@@ --@@ price their goods in dollars .
because these countries are ke@@ en to maintain their share in the world &apos;s biggest market , they often absor@@ b the effect of a drop in the dollar by cutting their profits rather than raise prices .
as a recent study by J@@ .@@ P@@ . M@@ org@@ an &apos;s Chi@@ e@@ f Econ@@ om@@ ist John Li@@ p@@ sky shows , the lin@@ k between exchange rates and trade is weak@@ ening .
what makes US strategy reck@@ less is that the Bush administration is att@@ ac@@ king China at the very moment that America &apos;s dependence on Chinese purch@@ ases of US government bonds is growing .
without these purch@@ ases , the US might face a rise in domestic interest rates that could thre@@ aten both its economic recovery and the global economy .
moreover , if China decided to sell its dollar hol@@ dings , the bond market would dis@@ coun@@ t US government securities , raising US long @-@ term interest rates and canc@@ eling much ( perhaps all ) of whatever stimulus has been provided by the dollar &apos;s de@@ preci@@ ation .
lu@@ ck@@ i@@ ly , China &apos;s government knows that America &apos;s ad@@ vice to let the renminbi flo@@ at right now is dang@@ er@@ ous@@ --@@ both to China and for the world economy .
policies intended to benefit one country &apos;s economy at the expen@@ se of another , such as competitive de@@ valu@@ ations , were widespread during the Great Depression of the 19@@ 30 &apos;s .
for most of the post@@ war era , governments appeared to have learned the lesson of that time .
so it is bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re that , today , leaders in the world &apos;s strong@@ est economies are d@@ ab@@ b@@ ling in such dangerous non@@ sense again .
to fi@@ x its domestic problems , America must ti@@ gh@@ ten its budget , not drive down the dollar &apos;s value .
but with presidential elections lo@@ om@@ ing , no US government would cut spending or raise taxes .
so for@@ get about the economically illi@@ ter@@ ate Bush administration dar@@ ing to do either .
the sil@@ ver lin@@ ing here is that this failure may revi@@ ve the re@@ alization that no coun@@ tr@@ y@@ --@@ not even mi@@ gh@@ ty Ameri@@ ca@@ --@@ can de@@ value its way out of trou@@ ble .
the E@@ m@@ erg@@ ing Economi@@ es &quot; Eurozone Cri@@ sis
Washington , DC - Mo@@ st of today &apos;s economic institutions , from money to banking , e@@ vol@@ ved over many years - the un@@ intended consequences of decisions by millions of individuals .
by contrast , the eurozone stands out for being a de@@ liber@@ ate creation .
it is argu@@ ably the world &apos;s second @-@ largest , de@@ liber@@ ately @-@ plann@@ ed economic structure , after Comm@@ un@@ ism .
the eurozone is a remark@@ able experi@@ ment , a genuine v@@ ang@@ u@@ ard of global progress .
as 2012 comes to a close , it is in trou@@ ble , and every effort must be made to n@@ ur@@ ture and strengthen it .
by the second half of 2011 , it was evi@@ dent that emerging economies , which had we@@ a@@ ther@@ ed the financial crisis that began in 2008 moder@@ ately well , were taking on water as the eurozone crisis deep@@ ened .
growth slow@@ ed sharply in Brazil , India , China , and other countries .
central banks acted as len@@ ders of last res@@ ort , thereby a@@ ver@@ ting a major crisis .
in December 2011 and Febru@@ ary 2012 , the European Central Bank announced the long @-@ term re@@ financing operation ( L@@ T@@ R@@ O ) , where@@ by European banks were l@@ ent around â¬ 1 trillion ( $ 1.@@ 3 trillion ) in two tran@@ ches .
then , in July , came ECB President M@@ ario Dra@@ gh@@ i &apos;s fam@@ ous ass@@ ur@@ ance to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro .
the United States Federal Reserve in@@ jected liquidity , as did other advanced countries &quot; central banks .
there was a collective si@@ gh of relief , financial markets stabili@@ zed , and industrial @-@ production re@@ bo@@ und@@ ed .
the question on everyone &apos;s mind now is whether this post @-@ stor@@ m cal@@ m will last , allowing the global economy to pi@@ ck up .
no@@ where does this question loo@@ m larger than in developing and emerging economies , which are outside the main the@@ ater of the crisis , but are more prec@@ ari@@ ously posi@@ tioned than the advanced countries .
many had only recently be@@ gun to grow rapidly , and , with vast reser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s of poor people , economic growth has a moral ur@@ gency that it does not have in rich countries .
so , will the global economy stage a sustained recovery ?
exam@@ ining the past as care@@ fully as I can , and aw@@ are of the risks of au@@ g@@ ury , my answer has to be no .
until 2015 , the out@@ look is g@@ lo@@ om@@ y for Europe and , by exten@@ sion , for the emerging and developing economies .
the in@@ jec@@ tion of liquidity that occurred over the last year was the right policy .
but it only b@@ ought time ; it did not solve the problem .
and time is running out .
unfortunately , most people have an inst@@ inc@@ tive pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to look away from appro@@ ach@@ ing problems until they are very close .
America &apos;s &quot; fiscal cli@@ ff , &quot; for example , was long in coming , but we are s@@ cra@@ m@@ b@@ ling to avoid it only now .
so we should take early stock of the fact that there is another problem coming our way , which may be called ( to give it the res@@ on@@ ance of a coming stor@@ m ) E@@ d@@ ward - &amp; # 160 ; the &quot; European De@@ bt Wall and re@@ pay@@ ment de@@ ad@@ line . &quot;
the L@@ T@@ R@@ O money that banks received on such easy terms , we must rec@@ all , took the form of three @-@ year loans , which implies a w@@ all of debt re@@ pay@@ ment in December 2014 and Febru@@ ary 2015 .
if Europe succ@@ ee@@ ds in making major fiscal and banking reforms and gets its economy in order , E@@ d@@ ward will lose ste@@ am .
if not , the crisis will per@@ sist , and Europe will be ro@@ ck@@ ed as E@@ d@@ ward makes land@@ fall by the end of 2014 .
where does that leave developing countries ?
the US and Europe are the world &apos;s two largest economic power@@ hous@@ es .
their slowdown will have an ad@@ verse impact on all emerging economies .
moreover , the US and Europe have already used large do@@ ses of fiscal stimulus , which sha@@ res an un@@ c@@ ann@@ y similar@@ ity to anti@@ bio@@ tics .
administ@@ ered over a short du@@ ration , it can be a powerful anti@@ do@@ te ; but , used repe@@ ate@@ dly over too long a period , the side effects can out@@ stri@@ p the benefits .
consider the case of India .
since 2009 , India has been exp@@ anding its deficit as a de@@ liber@@ ate measure to counter its economic slowdown .
because fiscal expansion followed several years of re@@ stra@@ int , it was very effective in sp@@ ur@@ ring demand and output growth .
but now the sco@@ pe for further expansion is limited .
unlike advanced countries , most emerging economies are ex@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing in@@ flationary pres@@ sures , which could be exac@@ erb@@ ated by another round of stimulus spending .
so the short @-@ run situation remains prec@@ ari@@ ous .
nevertheless , for emerging economies , the medi@@ um@@ - to long @-@ term prospects are b@@ right .
countries that are saving a substantial amount , invest@@ ing in human capital , and providing a mo@@ dic@@ um of good governance should resu@@ me their previous rapid growth .
India , for example , is saving and invest@@ ing well over 30 % of its GDP , de@@ vot@@ ing a significant share of these resources to infrastructure .
its entrep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al capacity is exp@@ anding .
in several recent years , India &apos;s out@@ ward direct investment in Britain has exc@@ ee@@ ded in@@ ward direct investment from Britain .
so , once the crisis is over , annual growth should re@@ bound to its earlier rate of more than 8 % .
investors seem to be taking this view to heart .
they have been ti@@ ght@@ fi@@ sted when it comes to short @-@ term equity investments .
but , when it comes to long @-@ term direct investment , they committed a record @-@ high $ 4@@ 3.@@ 8 billion to India in 2011 @-@ 2012 .
beyond the current crisis , the prospect appears to be similar in other major emerging economies , including Brazil , China , and Indonesia .
easing short @-@ term j@@ it@@ ters and pa@@ ving the way for further developing @-@ country growth will require a clear and credible program for re@@ turning high @-@ income economies , especially those in Europe , to a sustainable fiscal path .
it will be a bu@@ mp@@ y road ahead , requ@@ iring care@@ ful n@@ avi@@ g@@ ation and b@@ old policy implement@@ ation .
the Di@@ a@@ bet@@ es W@@ at@@ ch
W@@ ell@@ ing@@ ton - The world is currently in the gri@@ p of a di@@ a@@ bet@@ es epide@@ mi@@ c .
a recent major study by Ma@@ j@@ id E@@ zz@@ at@@ i and colle@@ ag@@ ues from Imp@@ eri@@ al Col@@ le@@ ge London and Har@@ v@@ ard University found that the number of ad@@ ul@@ ts with type 2 di@@ a@@ bet@@ es increased from an estimated 15@@ 3 million in 1980 to 3@@ 4@@ 7 million in 2008 .
the number could be 3@@ 70 million today .
every region of the world is affected , although the epide@@ mi@@ c is growing most rapidly in O@@ ce@@ ania and least rapidly in East Asia .
glob@@ ally , the type 2 di@@ a@@ bet@@ es epide@@ mi@@ c has been growing in lock@@ step with rising o@@ be@@ si@@ ty levels .
this is not surpri@@ sing - an increase in body fat and a de@@ cre@@ ase in physical activity are the direct causes of type 2 ( as op@@ posed to type 1 ) di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
in fact , much of the health effects of o@@ be@@ si@@ ty and physical in@@ activity are medi@@ ated through di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
these health effects are serious .
di@@ a@@ bet@@ es already is the major cause of ki@@ d@@ ney failure , blin@@ d@@ ness , and lower @-@ lim@@ b amp@@ ut@@ ation in many countries , and a major cause of heart attacks and stro@@ kes .
despite this , surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es remains relatively un@@ developed throughout the world , even in high @-@ income countries .
public @-@ health surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance is &quot; the ongoing systemati@@ c collec@@ tion , analysis , interpre@@ tation , and dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ation of health data for the pur@@ pose of prev@@ enting and contro@@ lling disease &quot; - in short , information for action .
there is nothing in this defini@@ tion that restric@@ ts surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance to communic@@ able diseases , yet in practice this has generally been the case .
the reasons are not hard to find .
communic@@ able disease out@@ break@@ s occur over days to weeks ( or at the most , months ) ; the danger is &quot; clear and present &quot; ; and pre@@ vention and control generally requires intervention by the state - the quar@@ ant@@ ine of victims , trac@@ ing and imm@@ uni@@ zation of con@@ tac@@ ts , or elimin@@ ation of environmental sources of the inf@@ ec@@ tious ag@@ ent .
the situation regar@@ ding chroni@@ c diseases like di@@ a@@ bet@@ es is very different .
the epide@@ mi@@ c happen@@ s sil@@ ently over years or decades ; the danger is either not recognized or not considered avoi@@ dable ; and action is often seen as the responsibility of the individual ( li@@ fest@@ yle modi@@ fication ) or health @-@ care system ( p@@ harm@@ ac@@ eu@@ ti@@ cal pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion ) , rather than the state .
yet effective chroni@@ c disease surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance can save lives .
if disease trends are monit@@ o@@ red , along with patients &quot; respon@@ ses to treatment and the population &apos;s ex@@ pos@@ ure to risk factors , the success or failure of policies designed to prevent or control chroni@@ c diseases can be e@@ valu@@ ated , resource alloc@@ ation can be ration@@ ally pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed , and the public can be kept fully in@@ formed of the risks that they face .
recogni@@ zing this , in December 2005 the New York City Bo@@ ard of He@@ alth mand@@ ated the lab@@ or@@ atory repor@@ ting of test results for gl@@ y@@ co@@ sy@@ l@@ ated ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) - a bi@@ om@@ ark@@ er for di@@ a@@ bet@@ es and a key indic@@ ator of blo@@ od g@@ lu@@ co@@ se control - thereby creating the world &apos;s first population @-@ based di@@ a@@ bet@@ es regi@@ stry .
mand@@ atory lab@@ or@@ atory repor@@ ting of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c results ( along with basic demographi@@ c data ) for a defined population ( New York City re@@ sidents ) allowed New York &apos;s De@@ par@@ tment of He@@ alth to monit@@ or trends in di@@ a@@ bet@@ es pre@@ val@@ ence , ass@@ ess te@@ sting co@@ verage , and exam@@ ine health @-@ care use and gl@@ y@@ c@@ emi@@ c control of re@@ sidents living with di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
beyond these population @-@ based surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance func@@ tions , the regi@@ stry was able to support pati@@ ent care by ensuring that individual health @-@ care provi@@ ders and patients were made aw@@ are of el@@ ev@@ ated or rising H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels . both the pati@@ ent @-@ support func@@ tion and the surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance func@@ tion required use of a uni@@ que pati@@ ent identi@@ fi@@ er , so that let@@ ters could be ma@@ iled to patients and tests from the same pati@@ ent could be linked over time .
in 2009 , T@@ hom@@ as Frie@@ den and colle@@ ag@@ ues from the New York City Bo@@ ard of He@@ alth re@@ viewed the regi@@ stry &apos;s first four years of operation and conclu@@ ded that it was per@@ forming well .
getting all lab@@ or@@ at@@ ories to report regul@@ arly and comple@@ t@@ ely , however , proved challeng@@ ing and not all health @-@ care provi@@ ders and patients proved willing to particip@@ ate .
the Bo@@ ard of He@@ alth &apos;s initiative has been widely pra@@ is@@ ed as ex@@ emp@@ li@@ fying the app@@ lic@@ ation of classi@@ cal communic@@ able @-@ disease surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance @-@ and @-@ control tools to a chroni@@ c disease .
other comm@@ ent@@ ators , however , have criti@@ ci@@ zed the regi@@ stry for potentially com@@ promising pati@@ ent confi@@ denti@@ ality and priv@@ acy , and even for dis@@ rup@@ ting the relationship between patients and their doc@@ tors .
while these criti@@ ci@@ s@@ ms may or may not be justi@@ fied , it is probably true to say that the New York City di@@ a@@ bet@@ es regi@@ stry , though highly innovative , is at best an inter@@ im solution .
rather than rel@@ ying on lab@@ or@@ atory repor@@ ting of a single bi@@ om@@ ark@@ er , an ide@@ al chroni@@ c @-@ disease surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance system would ex@@ trac@@ t all necessary data directly from the pati@@ ent record .
any diagno@@ sis of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , or sub@@ sequ@@ ent monit@@ oring of disease progres@@ sion , requires a medical consu@@ l@@ tation and h@@ ence an entr@@ y into the pati@@ ent record - and so into the practice &apos;s pati@@ ent @-@ management information system .
logi@@ cally , the surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance system should operate by ex@@ trac@@ ting the entire sub@@ set of data required for surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance pur@@ poses from each health @-@ care provi@@ der &apos;s pati@@ ent management information system ( &quot; front @-@ end cap@@ ture &quot; ) .
this data would then be sec@@ u@@ rely trans@@ fer@@ red ( elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ cally ) to a su@@ itable data wa@@ re@@ house .
after appropriate cle@@ an@@ ing ( ch@@ ec@@ king for mis@@ sing data , correc@@ ting co@@ ding err@@ ors ) , and an@@ on@@ y@@ mi@@ zing , the data would be available for access and qu@@ er@@ ying .
given appropriate statisti@@ cal analysis and care@@ ful interpre@@ tation , us@@ eful re@@ ports could be gener@@ ated for surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance pur@@ poses and , if desi@@ red , for pati@@ ent @-@ care support as well ( using en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted uni@@ que pati@@ ent identi@@ fi@@ ers to pre@@ serve confi@@ denti@@ ality of personal information ) .
in view of the rising burden of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es and other chroni@@ c diseases throughout the world , urg@@ ent attention must be de@@ voted to strengthening surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance systems for non@@ communic@@ able diseases at all levels - from local practices to global institutions .
the Di@@ arr@@ he@@ a Pi@@ on@@ e@@ ers
Pal@@ o A@@ L@@ TO - O@@ n top of the de@@ v@@ ast@@ ation caused in Ha@@ it@@ i by the January ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake , H@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e T@@ om@@ as this month , and the sub@@ sequ@@ ent dis@@ loc@@ ations , ex@@ pos@@ ure , and mal@@ nut@@ ri@@ tion , the country is now experi@@ en@@ cing an acceler@@ ating ch@@ ol@@ era out@@ break . at least 8@@ ,000 people are currently in ho@@ spit@@ al , and the death tol@@ l is near 6@@ 00 from this w@@ ater@@ bor@@ ne bac@@ teri@@ al disease .
and , given the widespread un@@ avail@@ ability of cle@@ an water , basic san@@ it@@ ation , and medical faci@@ lities , those numbers are sure to increase .
even in the absence of natural disa@@ sters , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a is the number @-@ two inf@@ ec@@ tious kil@@ ler of children under the age of five in developing countries ( sur@@ pass@@ ed only by resp@@ ir@@ atory diseases ) , accoun@@ ting for roughly two million deaths a year .
however , th@@ anks to a simple but in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous innovation by an emerging Bi@@ o@@ science company , those numbers could become a reli@@ c of the past , like mor@@ ta@@ lity from sm@@ all@@ po@@ x and bub@@ oni@@ c pla@@ gue .
since the 19@@ 60 &quot; s , the standard of care for chil@@ d@@ hood di@@ arr@@ he@@ a in the developing world has been the World He@@ alth Organization &apos;s form@@ ul@@ ation of re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution , a g@@ lu@@ co@@ se @-@ based , high @-@ so@@ di@@ um li@@ qui@@ d that is administ@@ ered or@@ ally .
this low @-@ te@@ ch product was revolution@@ ary .
it sa@@ ved coun@@ t@@ less lives and reduced the need for costly ( and often un@@ available ) ho@@ spit@@ al sta@@ ys and in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion .
however , this product did nothing to l@@ essen the sever@@ ity or du@@ ration of the condi@@ tion , which over time leads to mal@@ nut@@ ri@@ tion , an@@ emi@@ a , and other chroni@@ c health risks .
other appro@@ aches to treat@@ ments and prev@@ ent@@ ative measures - including changes in public @-@ health policy , impro@@ vement of water treatment , and development of vacc@@ ines - have not yi@@ el@@ ded significant , cost @-@ effective results .
the solution ( liter@@ ally and figu@@ ra@@ tively ) may be an in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous , af@@ for@@ dable innovation from V@@ ent@@ ri@@ a Bi@@ o@@ science that combin@@ es high@@ - and low @-@ te@@ ch comp@@ onents to deliver what could be a ver@@ itable H@@ ol@@ y Gra@@ il : two prot@@ eins produced in@@ expen@@ sively in ri@@ ce that radi@@ cally improve the effec@@ tiveness of re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solutions .
it has been known for decades that bre@@ ast @-@ f@@ ed children get si@@ ck with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and other inf@@ ec@@ tions less often than those f@@ ed with form@@ ula .
research in Per@@ u has shown that for@@ ti@@ fying or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution with two of the primary protec@@ tive prot@@ eins in bre@@ ast mil@@ k , lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in and l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me , l@@ essen@@ s the du@@ ration of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and redu@@ ces the rate of rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ ce . &amp; # 160 ; The avail@@ ability of such an or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution to people in the developing world would be a near @-@ mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ous advance .
V@@ ent@@ ri@@ a jo@@ ined with rese@@ arch@@ ers at the University of C@@ aliforni@@ a , D@@ av@@ is , and at a leading children &apos;s ho@@ spit@@ al and a nut@@ ri@@ tion institu@@ te in L@@ im@@ a , Per@@ u , to test the effects of ad@@ ding lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in and l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me to a ri@@ ce @-@ based or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution . the new bre@@ w provides more nut@@ ri@@ tion than g@@ lu@@ co@@ se @-@ based or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution and ta@@ stes better to ki@@ ds , so they are more likely to drin@@ k it .
the rese@@ arch@@ ers found that when lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in and l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me are added to solution , the children &apos;s ill@@ ness is cut from more than five days to 3.@@ 7 .
this impro@@ vement is thought to be caused by the anti@@ mi@@ cro@@ bi@@ al effect of lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in and l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me , long known to be the primary protec@@ tive prot@@ eins in bre@@ ast mil@@ k .
moreover , over the t@@ wel@@ ve @-@ month follow @-@ up period , the children who had received the ri@@ ce @-@ based solution had less than half the rec@@ ur@@ ren@@ ce rate of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( 8 % versu@@ s 18 % in the control s@@ ample ) .
this effect is probably caused by the lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in , which promot@@ es re@@ pa@@ ir of the di@@ arr@@ he@@ a @-@ dam@@ aged c@@ ells of the inte@@ stin@@ al mu@@ co@@ s@@ a .
what makes this approach to man@@ aging di@@ arr@@ he@@ a fe@@ a@@ sible is V@@ ent@@ ri@@ a &apos;s inv@@ en@@ tion of a gene@@ tic @-@ engine@@ ering meth@@ od that uses ri@@ ce to produce lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in and l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me .
this process , du@@ b@@ bed &quot; bi@@ op@@ har@@ ming , &quot; is an in@@ expensive and in@@ gen@@ i@@ ous way to syn@@ the@@ size the large quanti@@ ties of the prot@@ eins that will be necessary .
in effect , the ri@@ ce pl@@ ants &quot; in@@ pu@@ ts are carbon dio@@ xi@@ de , water , so@@ il , and the su@@ n &apos;s energy , and its output is a ri@@ ce ker@@ ne@@ l con@@ taining large amounts of the prot@@ eins .
the ker@@ ne@@ l is proc@@ essed to ex@@ trac@@ t and pu@@ ri@@ fy the prot@@ eins , which are then used to form@@ ul@@ ate the improved re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution .
ri@@ ce is self @-@ pol@@ lin@@ ating , so out @-@ cro@@ s@@ sing - inter@@ bre@@ e@@ ding with other ri@@ ce v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties - is virtually impossible .
however , to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate even such hy@@ po@@ the@@ ti@@ cal concerns , V@@ ent@@ ri@@ a has cho@@ sen to grow its ri@@ ce in K@@ ans@@ as , where there are no other ri@@ ce gro@@ wers .
the prot@@ eins used to sup@@ ple@@ ment the or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution have the same structure and func@@ tional proper@@ ties as those in natural bre@@ ast mil@@ k , and the process is an@@ alo@@ g@@ ous to that used ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely for the production of prot@@ eins from other organis@@ ms , such as bac@@ teri@@ a and ye@@ ast .
the prot@@ eins were jud@@ ged by a regulatory pan@@ el of experts to be &quot; generally recognized A@@ s S@@ af@@ e &quot; ( Gr@@ as ) for inclu@@ sion in food products like or@@ al re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion solution .
the typi@@ cal approach pri@@ or to commer@@ ci@@ alization would be a no@@ ti@@ fication to the United States Fo@@ od &amp; amp ; Dru@@ g Administration ( F@@ D@@ A ) that the ri@@ ce @-@ produced prot@@ eins had been determined to be as safe as their natural counter@@ parts .
then , the regulators &quot; re@@ view would take no more than six months .
but , while the first Gr@@ as no@@ ti@@ fication was sub@@ mit@@ ted to F@@ D@@ A in 2004 and was followed by further no@@ ti@@ fic@@ ations , the F@@ D@@ A took no action ; eventually , V@@ ent@@ ri@@ a with@@ dre@@ w the no@@ ti@@ fic@@ ations in March of this year .
although the company could market the product without the F@@ D@@ A &apos;s appro@@ val , the financial risks would be pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tive .
rese@@ arch@@ ers at the University of C@@ aliforni@@ a , D@@ av@@ is , have faced similar regulatory obstac@@ les in attemp@@ ting to produce l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me in the mil@@ k of gene@@ ti@@ cally engine@@ ered go@@ ats .
their solution was to move the project to Brazil , where it is progres@@ sing .
bi@@ op@@ har@@ ming has brought us to the ver@@ ge of a safe , af@@ for@@ dable solution to one of the developing world &apos;s most pressing health problems .
but , th@@ anks to bureau@@ cratic ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism , it will come too late for the many who will be stri@@ cken with di@@ arr@@ he@@ al diseases in Ha@@ it@@ i and other poor countries in the coming weeks and months .
regulators and public @-@ health authorities should be be@@ ating down do@@ ors and dem@@ anding life @-@ saving products like lac@@ to@@ fer@@ r@@ in and l@@ y@@ so@@ zy@@ me .
instead , all we he@@ ar from them is a de@@ af@@ ening sil@@ ence - and , in Ha@@ it@@ i and elsewhere , the sil@@ ence of the gra@@ ve .
the D@@ ie@@ t De@@ bac@@ le
S@@ an F@@ R@@ A@@ N@@ C@@ IS@@ C@@ O - T@@ wo seem@@ ingly ben@@ ig@@ n nut@@ ri@@ tional ma@@ xim@@ s are at the ro@@ ot of all di@@ etary evi@@ l : a cal@@ ori@@ e is a cal@@ ori@@ e , and Y@@ o@@ u are what you e@@ at . &amp; # 160 ; Bot@@ h ideas are now so ent@@ ren@@ ched in public con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness that they have become virtually un@@ as@@ sa@@ il@@ able .
as a result , the food industry , ai@@ ded and a@@ bet@@ ted by o@@ sten@@ sibly well @-@ mean@@ ing scientists and politicians , has aff@@ lic@@ ted hum@@ ank@@ in@@ d with the pla@@ gue of chroni@@ c met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c disease , which threat@@ ens to bank@@ rupt health care worldwide .
the United States currently sp@@ ends $ 1@@ 4@@ 7 billion on o@@ be@@ si@@ ty @-@ related health care annually .
pre@@ viously , one could have argued that these were aff@@ lu@@ ent countries &quot; diseases , but the United Nations announced last year that chroni@@ c met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c disease ( including di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , heart disease , cancer , and de@@ men@@ ti@@ a ) is a bi@@ g@@ ger threat to the developing world than is inf@@ ec@@ tious disease , including HIV .
these two nut@@ ri@@ tional ma@@ xim@@ s give cre@@ dence to the food industry &apos;s self @-@ ser@@ ving cor@@ oll@@ aries : if a cal@@ ori@@ e is a cal@@ ori@@ e , then any food can be part of a balanced di@@ et ; and , if we are what we e@@ at , then everyone cho@@ o@@ ses what they e@@ at .
again , both are mis@@ leading .
if one &apos;s weight really is a matter of personal responsibility , how can we explain to@@ dd@@ ler o@@ be@@ si@@ ty ?
indeed , the US has an o@@ be@@ si@@ ty epide@@ mi@@ c in six @-@ month @-@ olds .
they don &apos;t di@@ et or exerci@@ se .
conver@@ sely , up to 40 % of normal @-@ weight people have chroni@@ c met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c disease .
something else is going on .
consider the following di@@ ets : At@@ k@@ ins ( all fat and no car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates ) ; traditional Japanese ( all car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates and little fat ) ; and Or@@ ni@@ sh ( even less fat and car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates with l@@ ots of fi@@ ber ) .
all three help to maintain , and in some cases even improve , met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c health , because the li@@ ver has to deal with only one energy source at a time .
that is how human bo@@ dies are designed to met@@ ab@@ oli@@ ze food .
our h@@ unter anc@@ est@@ ors ate fat , which was tran@@ spor@@ ted to the li@@ ver and bro@@ ken down by the li@@ pol@@ y@@ tic pa@@ th@@ way to deliver f@@ at@@ ty aci@@ ds to the mi@@ to@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a ( the sub@@ c@@ ell@@ ular structures that bur@@ n food to create energy ) .
on the occ@@ asion of a big kil@@ l , any excess di@@ etary f@@ at@@ ty aci@@ ds were pack@@ aged into low @-@ den@@ si@@ ty li@@ po@@ prot@@ eins and tran@@ spor@@ ted out of the li@@ ver to be sto@@ red in peripher@@ al fat ti@@ s@@ su@@ e .
as a result , our fore@@ be@@ ars &quot; li@@ vers sta@@ yed healthy .
meanwhile , our ga@@ ther@@ er anc@@ est@@ ors ate car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates ( pol@@ ym@@ ers of g@@ lu@@ co@@ se ) , which was also tran@@ spor@@ ted to the li@@ ver , via the gl@@ y@@ col@@ y@@ tic pa@@ th@@ way , and bro@@ ken down for energy .
any excess g@@ lu@@ co@@ se stimul@@ ated the pan@@ cre@@ as to rele@@ ase insu@@ lin , which tran@@ spor@@ ted g@@ lu@@ co@@ se into peripher@@ al fat ti@@ s@@ su@@ e , and which also caused the li@@ ver to st@@ ore g@@ lu@@ co@@ se as gl@@ y@@ co@@ gen ( li@@ ver star@@ ch ) .
so their li@@ vers also sta@@ yed healthy .
and nature did its part by sup@@ pl@@ ying all nat@@ ur@@ ally oc@@ curr@@ ing fo@@ od@@ stu@@ ffs with either fat or car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate as the energy source , not both .
even f@@ at@@ ty fru@@ its - co@@ con@@ ut , oli@@ ves , avo@@ c@@ ad@@ os - are low in car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate .
our met@@ ab@@ oli@@ s@@ ms started to mal@@ func@@ tion when hum@@ ans began consum@@ ing fat and car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates at the same me@@ al .
the li@@ ver mi@@ to@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a could not keep up with the energy on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght , and had no choice but to emplo@@ y a little @-@ used escap@@ e val@@ ve called &quot; de Nov@@ o li@@ po@@ gene@@ sis &quot; ( new fat @-@ making ) to turn excess energy sub@@ str@@ ate into li@@ ver fat .
li@@ ver fat mu@@ cks up the work@@ ings of the li@@ ver .
it is the ro@@ ot cause of the phen@@ om@@ en@@ on known as &quot; insu@@ lin resistance &quot; and the primary process that dri@@ ves chroni@@ c met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c disease .
in other words , neither fat nor car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates are problemati@@ c - until they are combined .
the food industry does precisely that , mi@@ x@@ ing more of both into the Western di@@ et for pal@@ at@@ ability and sh@@ el@@ f life , thereby intensi@@ fying insu@@ lin resistance and chroni@@ c met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c disease .
but there is one exc@@ eption to this form@@ ul@@ ation : su@@ gar .
Su@@ cro@@ se and high @-@ fru@@ c@@ to@@ se cor@@ n sy@@ ru@@ p are com@@ pri@@ sed of one m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of g@@ lu@@ co@@ se ( not especially s@@ we@@ et ) and one m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of fru@@ c@@ to@@ se ( very s@@ we@@ et ) .
while g@@ lu@@ co@@ se is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by the gl@@ y@@ col@@ y@@ tic pa@@ th@@ way , fru@@ c@@ to@@ se is met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed by the li@@ pol@@ y@@ tic pa@@ th@@ way , and is not insu@@ lin @-@ regul@@ ated .
thus , when su@@ gar is in@@ gest@@ ed in excess , the li@@ ver mi@@ to@@ ch@@ on@@ dri@@ a are so overwhel@@ med that they have no choice but to build li@@ ver fat .
today , 3@@ 3 % of Americans have a f@@ at@@ ty li@@ ver , which causes chroni@@ c met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c disease .
pri@@ or to 19@@ 00 , Americans consum@@ ed less than 30 gra@@ ms of su@@ gar per day , or about 6 % of total cal@@ ories .
in 197@@ 7 , it was 75 gra@@ ms / day , and in 1994 , up to 1@@ 10 gra@@ ms / day .
currently , ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ents average 1@@ 50 gra@@ ms / day ( roughly 30 % of total cal@@ ories ) - a five @-@ fol@@ d increase in one century , and a two @-@ fol@@ d increase in a generation .
in the past 50 years , consumption of su@@ gar has also doub@@ led worldwide .
worse yet , other than the ep@@ h@@ emer@@ al ple@@ as@@ ure that it provides , there is not a single bio@@ chemi@@ cal process that requires di@@ etary fru@@ c@@ to@@ se ; it is a v@@ esti@@ gi@@ al nut@@ ri@@ ent , left over from the e@@ volution@@ ary differ@@ enti@@ ation between pl@@ ants and anim@@ als .
it is therefore clear that a cal@@ ori@@ e is not a cal@@ ori@@ e .
f@@ ats , car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates , fru@@ c@@ to@@ se , and g@@ lu@@ co@@ se are all met@@ ab@@ oli@@ zed differ@@ ently in the body .
fur@@ ther@@ more , you are what you do with what you e@@ at@@ .@@ Com@@ bin@@ ing fat and car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ate places high demands on the met@@ ab@@ oli@@ c process . and ad@@ ding su@@ gar is particularly &amp; # 160 ; eg@@ regi@@ ous .
indeed , while food companies would have you believe that su@@ gar can be part of a balanced di@@ et , the bottom line is that they have created an un@@ balanced one .
of the 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 food it@@ ems available in the US , 80 % are lac@@ ed with added su@@ gar .
people cannot be held responsible for what they put in their m@@ ou@@ ths when their choices have been co @-@ op@@ ted .
and this br@@ ings us back to those ob@@ ese to@@ dd@@ lers .
the fru@@ c@@ to@@ se con@@ tent of a soft drin@@ k is 5@@ .@@ 3 % .
of course , many par@@ ents might ref@@ use to give soft drin@@ ks to their children , but the fru@@ c@@ to@@ se con@@ tent of so@@ y form@@ ula is 5@@ .@@ 1 % , and 6 % for ju@@ ice .
we have a long way to go to deb@@ un@@ k dangerous nut@@ ri@@ tional do@@ g@@ m@@ as .
until we do , we will make little head@@ way in re@@ vers@@ ing an im@@ min@@ ent medical and economic disaster .
the D@@ ig@@ it@@ al Di@@ vi@@ de
London : a global divi@@ sion is ar@@ is@@ ing between the world &apos;s compu@@ ter ha@@ ves and have @-@ not@@ s .
call it the digit@@ al divi@@ de .
seven months ago at the K@@ y@@ ush@@ u @-@ O@@ kin@@ a@@ wa Sum@@ mit the world &apos;s leading industrial countries established a D@@ ig@@ it@@ al Op@@ port@@ unity T@@ as@@ k@@ force ( d@@ ot@@ force ) to share information and communic@@ ation technologies with poor countries .
are compu@@ ter technologies , however , really so easily trans@@ fer@@ red ?
moreover , will governments in poor and post@@ communist countries sei@@ ze upon the sup@@ pos@@ edly ma@@ gi@@ cal powers of compu@@ ters as an exc@@ use not to pursue co@@ her@@ ent growth strategies ?
it is said that , unless developing and post@@ communist countries cat@@ ch up with the compu@@ ter &quot; revolution , &quot; their economies will fall ever f@@ ar@@ ther behind .
true , integration in the world economy offers the best hope for growth .
but global integration cannot be achieved by I@@ T alone .
indeed , the wor@@ d from Mi@@ cro@@ soft &apos;s Bill G@@ ates is that poor countries need sound development strategies , not a great lea@@ p into cy@@ ber@@ space .
poverty , under@@ development , and mal @-@ development result from macroeconomic and industrial policies , sk@@ e@@ wed income distribution , and f@@ la@@ wed market infra@@ structures .
of these , only the lat@@ ter may be affected posi@@ tively by I@@ T .
und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , the digit@@ al divi@@ de exclu@@ des much of the world &apos;s population by age , income and re@@ siden@@ ce from today &apos;s compu@@ ter revolution .
to benefit from In@@ formation and Comm@@ unic@@ ation Tech@@ n@@ ologi@@ es ( IC@@ T@@ s ) an economy requires , in addition to s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated tel@@ ec@@ om@@ m@@ unic@@ ations infrastructure , fundamental adv@@ ances in basic liter@@ acy and sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y technical education .
these are the pre @-@ conditions for successful technology transfers .
a liberal regulatory regime help@@ s , too .
so , clearly , the d@@ ot@@ force initiative is no stand @-@ alone development to@@ ol . governments must also act .
unfortunately , government actions usually ob@@ struc@@ t more than help .
some developing and post@@ communist countries c@@ ens@@ or the Internet by excess tax@@ ation and / or by li@@ mit@@ ing access .
so , as international agencies invest in compu@@ ters for developing countries they must identi@@ fy the obstac@@ les er@@ ected by governments to the di@@ ff@@ u@@ sion of IC@@ T@@ s , as well as the costs for over@@ coming these obstac@@ les .
moreover , technology transfer is not free .
the technical exper@@ ti@@ se required for I@@ T start @-@ ups will only be trans@@ fer@@ red by investors if they are compens@@ ated .
still , even if governments do everything right , the benefits of IC@@ T@@ s for low @-@ income countries are limited and difficult to predic@@ t .
right now , I@@ T exports offer the most promise .
high T@@ ech provides 28 % of East Asian and P@@ aci@@ fic regional exports .
the average level of high te@@ ch exports for all of South Asia is 4 % with India t@@ opp@@ ing 10 % .
India &apos;s so@@ ft@@ w@@ are exports , indeed , exc@@ ee@@ ded $ 4 billion in 2000 , about 9 % of India &apos;s total exports .
in Latin America and the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , high te@@ ch exports amount to 12 % of manufac@@ tured exports .
fu@@ eled by mi@@ cro@@ ch@@ i@@ p exports ( 3@@ 8 % of the total ) , Co@@ st@@ a Ri@@ ca &apos;s economy gre@@ w 8@@ .@@ 3 % in 1999 , the highest in Latin America .
domestic demand in developing and post@@ communist countries la@@ gs behind because people are usually too poor to buy I@@ T goods and services .
constra@@ ining demand even more is the fact that businesses in poor countries only need I@@ T when they have educ@@ ated work@@ forces , which most poor country firms neither have nor need .
to change all this , spending on education must change .
in high @-@ income countries public expendi@@ ture on education reached 5@@ .@@ 4 % of GDP in 1997 , in middle income countries it was 4.@@ 8 % , but only 3.@@ 3 % in low income countries , and only 2.@@ 2 % in Mal@@ i .
India , which sp@@ ends 3.@@ 2 % of GDP on education , rank@@ s lower than the average in Su@@ b @-@ Sah@@ aran Africa .
public spending , moreover , on education is often re@@ gres@@ sive .
in N@@ ep@@ al , the rich@@ est qu@@ in@@ ti@@ le recei@@ ves four times as much public education spending as the poorest qu@@ in@@ ti@@ le .
skills , including liter@@ acy , as well as infrastructure , will also hold the I@@ T revolution back .
the illi@@ ter@@ acy rate is 6@@ 8 % in Central African Republic , 5@@ 7 % in India , 16 % in South Africa .
in Africa , there are 14 million tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one lines , a fig@@ ure roughly compar@@ able to that of any of the world &apos;s major cities .
the Internet is of no benefit if you can &apos;t get online .
to ass@@ ure positive outcomes from IC@@ T investment , policymakers should focus on integr@@ ated development , tel@@ ec@@ om@@ m@@ unic@@ ations infrastructure , and education as the found@@ ation for gradu@@ al technology transfer .
priv@@ acy laws , tax@@ ation and open@@ ness are as important for the development of the Internet as for every other asp@@ ect of development .
institutional and political fail@@ ures will limit the capacity of developing countries to benefit from investments in technology in the same measure as developed countries , even when they actually acqu@@ ire compu@@ ters in op@@ tim@@ al numbers .
because of a lack of em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal evidence , it is too early to say that these obstac@@ les are bin@@ ding constra@@ ints .
but it is clear that I@@ T will deliver benefits only if sound development strategies are pursu@@ ed .
the failure of other &quot; ma@@ gi@@ c bul@@ let &quot; cu@@ res for development should make everyone p@@ au@@ se before plac@@ ing un@@ bo@@ und@@ ed faith in what the Internet can deliver .

the D@@ ig@@ it@@ al War on P@@ over@@ ty
new YORK - The digit@@ al divi@@ de is beginning to close .
the flow of digit@@ al information - through mobi@@ le ph@@ ones , text mess@@ aging , and the Internet - is now reaching the world &apos;s m@@ asses , even in the poorest countries , bringing with it a revolution in economics , politics , and society .
extreme poverty is almost sy@@ non@@ ym@@ ous with extreme isol@@ ation , especially rural isol@@ ation .
but mobi@@ le ph@@ ones and wi@@ rel@@ ess Internet end isol@@ ation , and will therefore prove to be the most trans@@ form@@ ative technology of economic development of our time .
the digit@@ al divi@@ de is ending not through a bur@@ st of civi@@ c responsibility , but mainly through market forces .
mobi@@ le ph@@ one technology is so powerful , and costs so little per un@@ it of data trans@@ mission , that it has proved possible to sell mobi@@ le ph@@ one access to the poor .
there are now more than 3.@@ 3 billion sub@@ s@@ cri@@ bers in the world , roughly one for every two people on the planet .
moreover , market pen@@ et@@ ration in poor countries is rising sharply .
India has around 300 million sub@@ s@@ cri@@ bers , with sub@@ s@@ cri@@ p@@ tions rising by a st@@ un@@ ning eight million or more per month .
Brazil now has more than 1@@ 30 million sub@@ s@@ cri@@ bers , and Indonesia has roughly 1@@ 20 million .
in Africa , which con@@ ta@@ ins the world &apos;s poorest countries , the market is so@@ aring , with more than 2@@ 80 million sub@@ s@@ cri@@ bers .
mobi@@ le ph@@ ones are now u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in vil@@ la@@ ges as well as cities .
if an individual does not have a c@@ ell ph@@ one , they almost surely know some@@ one who does .
probably a significant majority of Afri@@ cans have at least emer@@ gency access to a c@@ ell ph@@ one , either their own , a neighb@@ or &apos;s , or one at a commercial ki@@ o@@ s@@ k .
even more remark@@ able is the continuing &quot; conver@@ gence &quot; of digit@@ al information : wi@@ rel@@ ess systems increasingly lin@@ k mobi@@ le ph@@ ones with the Internet , personal compu@@ ters , and information services of all kin@@ ds .
the ar@@ ra@@ y of benefits is st@@ un@@ ning .
the rural poor in more and more of the world now have access to wi@@ rel@@ ess banking and payments systems , such as Ken@@ ya &apos;s fam@@ ous M @-@ P@@ ES@@ A system , which allow@@ s money transfers through the ph@@ one .
the information car@@ ried on the new networks sp@@ ans public health , medical care , education , banking , commer@@ ce , and enter@@ tain@@ ment , in addition to communic@@ ations among family and fri@@ ends .
India , home to world @-@ leading so@@ ft@@ w@@ are engine@@ ers , high @-@ te@@ ch companies , and a vast and den@@ sely popul@@ ated rural economy of some 7@@ 00 million poor people in need of connec@@ tivity of all kin@@ ds , has nat@@ ur@@ ally been a pi@@ on@@ e@@ er of digit@@ al @-@ led economic development .
government and business have increasingly te@@ am@@ ed up in public @-@ private partner@@ ships to provide crucial services on the digit@@ al net@@ work .
in the Indian states of An@@ d@@ hr@@ a Pra@@ des@@ h and Gu@@ j@@ ar@@ at , for example , emer@@ gency am@@ bul@@ ance services are now within reach of tens of millions of people , supported by c@@ ell ph@@ ones , s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated compu@@ ter systems , and increased public investments in rural health .
several large @-@ scale tel@@ em@@ e@@ dic@@ ine systems are now providing primary health and even car@@ di@@ a@@ c care to rural populations .
moreover , India &apos;s new rural employment guarantee sch@@ eme , just two years old , is not only emplo@@ ying millions of the poorest through public financing , but also is bringing tens of millions of them into the formal banking system , building on India &apos;s digit@@ al networks .
on the fully commercial side , the mobi@@ le revolution is creating a logi@@ sti@@ cs revolution in f@@ arm @-@ to @-@ reta@@ il mark@@ eting .
farmers and food reta@@ il@@ ers can conn@@ ect directly through mobi@@ le ph@@ ones and distribution hu@@ bs , enab@@ ling farmers to sell their c@@ rop@@ s at higher &quot; f@@ arm @-@ gate &quot; prices and without del@@ ay , while bu@@ yers can move those c@@ rop@@ s to markets with minim@@ um spo@@ il@@ age and lower prices for final consumers .
the strengthening of the value cha@@ in not only rais@@ es farmers &quot; incomes , but also em@@ powers cro@@ p diversi@@ fication and f@@ arm up@@ gra@@ ding more generally .
similarly , world @-@ leading so@@ ft@@ w@@ are firms are bringing information technology jobs , including business process out@@ sour@@ cing , right into the vil@@ la@@ ges through digit@@ al networks .
education will be similarly trans@@ formed .
throughout the world , schools at all levels will go global , jo@@ ining together in worldwide digit@@ al education networks .
children in the United States will learn about Africa , China , and India not only from boo@@ ks and vi@@ de@@ os , but also through direct lin@@ ks across cl@@ ass@@ ro@@ oms in different parts of the world .
students will share ideas through live ch@@ ats , shared cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ a , jo@@ int projects , and vi@@ de@@ os , ph@@ ot@@ os , and text sent over the digit@@ al net@@ work .
universities , too , will have global cl@@ asses , with students jo@@ ining lec@@ tures , discussion groups , and research te@@ ams from a do@@ zen or more universities at a time .
this past year , my own universi@@ ty - Col@@ um@@ bia University in New York City - te@@ am@@ ed up with universities in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , Nigeria , the United Kingdom , France , E@@ thi@@ op@@ ia , Malaysia , India , Can@@ ada , Singap@@ ore , and China in a &quot; Global C@@ l@@ ass@@ room &quot; that si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously conn@@ ected hundreds of students on more than a do@@ zen camp@@ uses in an exc@@ iting course on global sustainable development .
in my book The En@@ d of P@@ over@@ ty , I w@@ ro@@ te that extreme poverty can be ended by the year 20@@ 25 .
a ra@@ sh predic@@ ation , perhaps , given global violence , climate change , and threats to food , energy , and water supp@@ lies .
but digit@@ al information technologies , if dep@@ loy@@ ed co@@ oper@@ ati@@ vely and glob@@ ally , will be our most important new tools , because they will enable us to join together glob@@ ally in markets , social networks , and co@@ oper@@ ative efforts to solve our common problems .
the Di@@ lemma of c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty and I@@ ts U@@ se
Al@@ bert Ein@@ st@@ ein once said , &quot; I have no special gi@@ ft , but I am pas@@ sion@@ ately c@@ uri@@ ous . &quot; certainly , Ein@@ st@@ ein was being tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously modest .
but , just as certainly , c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty is a powerful driving force in scientific disco@@ very .
indeed , along with tal@@ ent and interest , as well as ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cal or other quantitative abilities , c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty is a necessary characteri@@ stic of any successful scienti@@ st .
c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty betra@@ ys emo@@ tional pas@@ sion .
it is a state of being invol@@ unt@@ arily gri@@ pped by something that is difficult to ward off and for which , since one cannot act otherwise , one is accoun@@ table only in a limited sense .
we all come into the world c@@ uri@@ ous , equi@@ pped with the psych@@ ological drive to ex@@ pl@@ ore the world and to expand the ter@@ ra@@ in that we think we ma@@ ster .
it is no co@@ inci@@ dence that a well @-@ known book on develop@@ mental psych@@ ology be@@ ars the ti@@ tle The scienti@@ st in the Cri@@ b , a work that tra@@ ces the par@@ all@@ els between small children &apos;s behavior and the proc@@ esses and research strategies that are usual in science .
but the ur@@ ge for knowledge that dri@@ ves in@@ born c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty to trans@@ c@@ end given h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons does not remain un@@ cur@@ bed .
par@@ ents can tell many a t@@ ale about how , with the beginning of school , their children &apos;s pla@@ y@@ ful approach sud@@ den@@ ly changes , as they must now focus on ob@@ jects dic@@ t@@ ated by the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
likewise , however desi@@ rable its ability to produce the un@@ expected and un@@ fo@@ rese@@ e@@ able , science today cannot claim that it is not accoun@@ table to society .
c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty is ins@@ ati@@ able and , in research , it is in@@ ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ably ti@@ ed to the un@@ fo@@ rese@@ e@@ ability of results .
research is an end@@ less process , with a de@@ stin@@ ation that no one can predic@@ t precisely .
the more that un@@ expected results , brought for@@ th by research in the lab@@ or@@ atory , are a pre@@ condi@@ tion for further innov@@ ations , the more pressure there is to bring the production of knowledge under control , to direct research in specific direc@@ tions , and to t@@ ame scientific c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty .
but c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty must not be limited too sever@@ ely , l@@ est science &apos;s ability to produce new knowledge be lost .
this di@@ lemma is at the center of many policy deb@@ ates sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing scientific research .
to be sure , not everything that ar@@ ous@@ es scientific c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty is contro@@ versi@@ al ; in fact , most scientific research is not .
still , the di@@ lemma is obvious in pi@@ on@@ e@@ ering fi@@ elds like bi@@ om@@ e@@ dic@@ ine , n@@ an@@ ot@@ ech@@ nology , and ne@@ uro@@ sci@@ ences .
research in these areas sometimes me@@ ets with v@@ eh@@ ement re@@ jec@@ tion , for example , on religious gro@@ unds with respect to stem @-@ c@@ ell research , or owing to fear with respect to the possibility of al@@ ter@@ ing human identity .
c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty implies a certain im@@ moder@@ ation , a certain necessary excess .
that is precisely what makes it a pas@@ sion : it is am@@ or@@ al and follow@@ s its own laws , which is why society insi@@ sts on t@@ am@@ ing it in various ways .
private investment in research direc@@ ts c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty on@@ to pa@@ ths where new scientific break@@ through@@ s promise high economic potential .
politicians expect research to func@@ tion as a mot@@ or of economic growth .
ethi@@ cs com@@ mis@@ sions want to establish limits on research , even if these require frequ@@ ent re @-@ negoti@@ ation .
the demand for more democratic in@@ put , finally , also se@@ eks to influence research pri@@ orities .
these consider@@ ations must be bor@@ ne in all efforts to support basic research .
in Europe , the establishment of the European Res@@ e@@ arch Council ( E@@ R@@ C ) is enter@@ ing a deci@@ sive ph@@ ase , with crucial implications concern@@ ing the role we are prepared to conc@@ e@@ de to scientific c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty .
for the first time , support for basic research is being made possible on the EU level .
individual te@@ ams are to enter a p@@ an @-@ European competition to determine the best of the best , opening a free space for scientific c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty and enab@@ ling the un@@ fo@@ rese@@ e@@ able outcomes that are characteri@@ stic of cutting @-@ ed@@ ge research .
the di@@ lemma - and it is a deci@@ sive one - is that today we ch@@ eri@@ sh the pas@@ sion@@ ate c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty of an Al@@ bert Ein@@ st@@ ein . but we still want to control the un@@ fo@@ rese@@ e@@ able consequences to which c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty leads .
the di@@ lemma must be overcome by allowing c@@ uri@@ o@@ si@@ ty to be prot@@ ected and supported , while trying to cap@@ ture those of its fru@@ its that will benefit society .
how we ac@@ compli@@ sh this must be continu@@ ously negoti@@ ated in the public sphere .
ir@@ redu@@ ci@@ ble contra@@ dic@@ tions will remain , and ther@@ ein lie the ambi@@ val@@ ence that characteri@@ zes modern societies &quot; stance toward science .
the Di@@ lemma of Mul@@ ti@@ cul@@ tu@@ rali@@ sm
many people have sud@@ den@@ ly become very he@@ si@@ t@@ ant about using the term &quot; multi@@ cultural society . &quot;
or they he@@ si@@ t@@ ate to use it appro@@ v@@ ingly , as a desi@@ rable ide@@ al that social reality should at least appro@@ xim@@ ate .
July &apos;s terrorist attacks in London demonstrated both the strength and the weak@@ ness of the conc@@ ept .
London is certainly a multi@@ cultural met@@ ro@@ poli@@ s .
an in@@ discrimin@@ ate attack such as a bom@@ b in the Un@@ der@@ ground will necessarily hit people of many cultural back@@ gro@@ unds and belie@@ fs .
si@@ t@@ ting , or more likely standing , in the &quot; tu@@ be &quot; ( as London &apos;s Un@@ der@@ ground is aff@@ ec@@ tion@@ ately known ) , one never ce@@ ases to be am@@ a@@ zed at the e@@ ase with which Jewish mo@@ thers and Muslim men , West Indian yo@@ ung@@ sters and South Asian busin@@ ess@@ men , and many others en@@ dur@@ e the same st@@ res@@ s@@ ful conditions and try to ligh@@ ten its impact by being civil to one another .
the terror attacks demonstrated not only how particular people helped each other , but also how the whole city , with all the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents of its human mi@@ x@@ ture , disp@@ la@@ yed a common spiri@@ t of re@@ sili@@ ence .
this is the positive side of a multi@@ cultural society .
care@@ ful obser@@ vers have always not@@ ed that it is stric@@ tly con@@ fin@@ ed to the public sphere , to life in those parts of the city that are shared by all .
it does not ex@@ tend in quite the same way to people &apos;s homes , let alone to their ways of life in the private sphere .
this is one reason why London has experienced the other , d@@ ark@@ er side of the multi@@ cultural society : the ven@@ e@@ er of multi@@ cul@@ tu@@ rali@@ sm is thin .
it does not take much to turn people of one group against those of others with whom they had appar@@ ently li@@ ved in peace .
we know this because it lies at the core of the mur@@ der@@ ous environment that gri@@ pped the Bal@@ kan@@ s in the 1990 &quot; s .
for decades ( and in some cases much longer ) , Ser@@ bs and C@@ ro@@ ats , - indeed , Or@@ thodo@@ x , C@@ atholi@@ c , and Muslim &quot; Yu@@ gosla@@ v@@ s &quot; - had li@@ ved together as neighbors .
few thought it possible that they would turn against each other in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ let@@ ting of such bru@@ tal en@@ or@@ mi@@ ty that it is very unlikely that Bosni@@ a @-@ Her@@ ze@@ go@@ v@@ ina can ever become a successful multi@@ cultural society .
yet it happened , and in a different way it is happen@@ ing now in Britain .
it is important to recognize that we are not tal@@ king about the return of age @-@ old hosti@@ lities .
ethnic and cultural conflicts today , often in the form of terrorism , are not the er@@ up@@ tion of a sup@@ pos@@ edly ex@@ t@@ inc@@ t vol@@ can@@ o .
they are , on the contrary , a speci@@ fic@@ ally modern phen@@ om@@ en@@ on .
for the terrorists themselves , such conflicts are one consequ@@ ence of the uns@@ ett@@ ling effects of moderni@@ zation .
bene@@ ath the ven@@ e@@ er of integration into a multi@@ cultural environment , many people - especially young men with an im@@ migr@@ ant back@@ ground - are lost in the world of contra@@ dic@@ tions around them .
their se@@ am@@ less , all @-@ embra@@ cing world of tradi@@ tion is gone , but they are not yet confi@@ dent citizens of the modern , individu@@ ali@@ stic world .
the question is not prim@@ arily one of employment , or even poverty , but of margin@@ alization and alien@@ ation , of the lack of a sense of bel@@ on@@ ging .
it is in such circumstances that the key feat@@ ure of terrorism comes into play : the pre@@ ach@@ ing of h@@ ate by often self @-@ appoin@@ ted leaders .
they are not necessarily religious leaders ; in the Bal@@ kan@@ s and elsewhere , they are nationali@@ sts who pre@@ ach the sup@@ eri@@ ority of one nation@@ ality over others .
but to call these h@@ ate @-@ mon@@ g@@ ers &quot; pre@@ ach@@ ers &quot; is f@@ it@@ ting nonetheless , because they inv@@ ari@@ ably appe@@ al to higher values to sanc@@ ti@@ fy crimin@@ al acts .
the mobili@@ zation of crimin@@ al energi@@ es by such pre@@ ach@@ ers of h@@ ate is itself a modern phen@@ om@@ en@@ on .
it is a far c@@ ry even from such doub@@ t@@ ful claims as the self @-@ determin@@ ation of pe@@ op@@ les defined as ethnic communities .
h@@ ate pre@@ ach@@ ers use highly modern meth@@ ods to enh@@ ance their personal power and to create ha@@ vo@@ c around them .
but counter@@ ing them does not invol@@ ve war@@ fare , or even a rhetori@@ cally loo@@ s@@ er &quot; war on terror . &quot;
of course , part of the answer is to identi@@ fy the relatively small number of people who are prepared to use their lives to destro@@ y the lives of others without distinc@@ tion or pur@@ pose .
but the more important issue is to identi@@ fy the pre@@ ach@@ ers of h@@ ate and stop their mur@@ der@@ ous inc@@ it@@ ement .
this is why it is so important to cap@@ ture and prosec@@ ute R@@ ado@@ v@@ an Kar@@ ad@@ zi@@ c , who sp@@ ur@@ red on the hom@@ i@@ ci@@ d@@ al ra@@ ge of so many Bosni@@ an Ser@@ bs .
and this is why milit@@ ant Islamist pre@@ ach@@ ers must be stopp@@ ed .
beyond this care@@ fully targe@@ ted - and , in principle , limited - task , there remains the need to strengthen the sphere of common values and cooperation in societies that will , after all , remain multi@@ cultural .
this will be difficult , and it must not be appro@@ ach@@ ed n@@ ai@@ vely .
differences will not - and need not - go away ; but ensuring that all citizens can rely on each other requires us to find a way to ex@@ tend and bol@@ ster the civi@@ c trust that we see in the public sphere .
the Diplom@@ acy of the B@@ lin@@ d
Paris - W@@ h@@ y do re@@ volu@@ tions so often take profession@@ al diplom@@ ats by surprise ?
is there something in their D@@ NA that makes them pre@@ fer the status quo so much that , more often than not , they are taken ab@@ ack by rapid changes , neither fo@@ rese@@ eing them nor kno@@ wing how to respond once they begin ?
what is happen@@ ing today in the Arab world is a revolution that may turn out to be for the Middle East the equivalent of what the French Revolution was for Europe in 17@@ 8@@ 9 : a pro@@ found and radical change that al@@ ters comple@@ t@@ ely the situation that prev@@ ail@@ ed before .
how many Bas@@ ti@@ ll@@ es will ultimately fall in the region , and at what pace , no one can say .
the only recent an@@ alo@@ gy is the collapse of the Soviet blo@@ c , followed by the de@@ mise of the Soviet Union itself , in 1989 @-@ 1991 .
who saw that sud@@ den and rapid trans@@ formation coming ?
as the German Democratic Republic was about to dis@@ appear , some top French diplom@@ ats in Germany were still ass@@ uring their government in Paris that the Soviet Union would never accept German re@@ uni@@ fication , so there was nothing to worry about : life would go on nearly as usual .
the spec@@ ter of a un@@ ited Germany was not to become a reality soon .
we saw the same conservative inst@@ inc@@ t at work with the first re@@ actions to the events in T@@ uni@@ sia , and then in Egypt . &quot; President B@@ en Al@@ i is in control of the situation , &quot; some said .
or &quot; President Mubarak has our complete confidence . &quot;
the United States managed to get it right , al@@ beit very slow@@ ly , whereas many European countries er@@ red on the side of the status quo for a much longer time , if not systemati@@ cally , as they ref@@ used to see that the region could be e@@ vol@@ ving in a direction contrary to what they de@@ em@@ ed to be in their strategic interest .
historical and geo@@ graphi@@ c pro@@ xi@@ mi@@ ty , together with energy depen@@ den@@ cy and fear of massive immigration , par@@ aly@@ zed European diplom@@ ats .
but there is something more fundamental underlying diplom@@ ats &quot; natural di@@ ffi@@ dence .
they are very often right in their read@@ ings of a given situation - the US diplomatic c@@ ab@@ les rele@@ ased by Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ ak@@ s , for example , include a sle@@ w of ma@@ ster@@ ful and pen@@ et@@ r@@ ating analy@@ ses .
but it is as if , owing to an excess of p@@ ru@@ dence , they cannot bring themselves to pursue their own argum@@ ents to their logi@@ cal conclu@@ sions .
revolution@@ ary rup@@ tures up@@ set diplom@@ ats &quot; fami@@ li@@ ar hab@@ its , both in terms of their personal con@@ tac@@ ts and , more import@@ antly , in terms of their thinking .
a fast @-@ forward th@@ ru@@ st into the un@@ known can be ex@@ hi@@ lar@@ ating , but it is also deeply fri@@ ghten@@ ing .
in the name of &quot; re@@ alism , &quot; diplom@@ ats and foreign @-@ policy strategi@@ sts are nat@@ ur@@ ally conservative .
indeed , it is no ac@@ ci@@ dent that H@@ en@@ ry K@@ is@@ sin@@ ger &apos;s ma@@ ster@@ pi@@ ece , A World Re@@ sto@@ red , was de@@ voted to the study of the re@@ creation of the world order by the Vi@@ en@@ n@@ a Congress after the rup@@ ture of the French Revolution , followed by the Na@@ po@@ le@@ oni@@ c adv@@ ent@@ ures .
is it more difficult to predic@@ t , and ad@@ just to , the coming of a fundamental change , than to def@@ end the present order , under the mot@@ to of &quot; the devi@@ l you know is always prefer@@ able to the devi@@ l you don &apos;t know ! &quot;
but , beyond these mental hab@@ its lie more structural reasons for the con@@ serv@@ ati@@ sm of foreign policymakers and diplom@@ ats .
by emphasi@@ zing the relations between states and governments over con@@ tac@@ ts with the opposition or civil societies ( when they exist in an identi@@ fi@@ able form ) , traditional diplomacy has created for itself a han@@ dic@@ ap that is difficult to overcome .
by requ@@ iring their diplom@@ ats to limit their con@@ tac@@ ts with &quot; alternative &quot; sources of information in a country , in order to avoid anta@@ g@@ oni@@ zing des@@ po@@ tic regimes , governments ir@@ re@@ medi@@ ably limit diplom@@ ats &quot; ability to see change coming , even when it is so close that nothing can be done .
when regimes lose legitimacy in the e@@ yes of their citizens , it is not reasonable to deri@@ ve one &apos;s information mainly from that regime &apos;s serv@@ ants and sy@@ co@@ ph@@ ants .
in such cases , diplom@@ ats will too often merely report the regime &apos;s re@@ ass@@ uring yet bi@@ ased analysis .
diplom@@ ats , instead , should be jud@@ ged by their ability to enter into a dialogue with all social actors : government represent@@ atives and business leaders , of course , but also represent@@ atives of civil society ( even if it exi@@ sts only in em@@ br@@ y@@ oni@@ c form ) .
with pro@@ per training and incentives , diplom@@ ats would be better equi@@ pped to anti@@ cip@@ ate change .
of course , not all Western foreign minist@@ ries are the same ; some do understand the need to n@@ ur@@ ture relation@@ ships with people outside the government - if not in opposition to it .
but one thing is clear : the more traditional foreign minist@@ ries tend to be , the more difficult it is for them and their diplom@@ ats to gra@@ s@@ p change .
ne@@ ed@@ less to say , the ability to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end change has become indi@@ sp@@ ens@@ able at a time when the world is experi@@ en@@ cing t@@ ec@@ t@@ oni@@ c geopolitical shif@@ ts .
the new Middle East that is emerging before us is probably both &quot; post @-@ Western , &quot; given the rise of new powers , and &quot; post - Islamist , &quot; with the re@@ vol@@ t led by young , technologi@@ cally sav@@ v@@ y people with no ties to political Islam wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever .
by being late in percei@@ ving change that they do not want to see coming , Western diplom@@ ats run the risk of losing on both levels : the regime and the people .
diplom@@ ats require open@@ ness and ima@@ gin@@ ation in order to carry out their respon@@ sibi@@ lities .
they should not ab@@ dic@@ ate these quali@@ ties when they are needed most .
the D@@ ir@@ t on Nu@@ clear Power
Singap@@ ore - Japan &apos;s nuclear crisis is a ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are , but it is not an an@@ om@@ al@@ y .
in fact , it is only the latest in a long line of nuclear ac@@ ci@@ dents invol@@ ving m@@ elt@@ dow@@ ns , explo@@ sions , fi@@ res , and loss of co@@ ol@@ ant - ac@@ ci@@ dents that have occurred during both normal operation and emer@@ gency conditions , such as d@@ rou@@ ghts and ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ak@@ es .
nuclear safety demands c@@ lar@@ ity about terms .
the Nu@@ clear Re@@ gul@@ atory Commission in the United States generally separ@@ ates un@@ plann@@ ed nuclear &quot; events &quot; into two cl@@ asses , &quot; inci@@ dents &quot; and &quot; ac@@ ci@@ dents . &quot;
inci@@ dents are un@@ fo@@ rese@@ en events and technical fail@@ ures that occur during normal plant operation and result in no off @-@ si@@ te rele@@ ases of radi@@ ation or severe damage to equi@@ p@@ ment .
ac@@ ci@@ dents ref@@ er to either off @-@ si@@ te rele@@ ases of radi@@ ation or severe damage to plant equi@@ p@@ ment .
the International Nu@@ clear and radi@@ ological event scale uses a seven @-@ level rank@@ ing sch@@ eme to rate the signific@@ ance of nuclear and radi@@ ological events : levels 1 @-@ 3 are &quot; inci@@ dents , &quot; and 4 @-@ 7 are &quot; ac@@ ci@@ dents , &quot; with a &quot; Le@@ v@@ el 7 Ma@@ j@@ or ac@@ ci@@ dent &quot; consist@@ ing of &quot; a major rele@@ ase of radi@@ o@@ active material with widespread health and environmental effects requ@@ iring implement@@ ation of plann@@ ed and exten@@ ded counter@@ measures . &quot;
under these classi@@ fic@@ ations , the number of nuclear ac@@ ci@@ dents , even including the m@@ elt@@ dow@@ ns at Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma D@@ ai@@ ich@@ i and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma D@@ a@@ ini , is low .
but if one re@@ defin@@ es an ac@@ ci@@ dent to include inci@@ dents that either resul@@ ted in the loss of human life or more than $ 5@@ 0,000 in property damage , a very different pi@@ c@@ ture emerg@@ es .
at least 9@@ 9 nuclear ac@@ ci@@ dents meeting this defini@@ tion , tot@@ aling more than $ 20@@ .@@ 5 billion in dam@@ ages , occurred worldwide from 195@@ 2 to 2009 - or more than one inci@@ dent and $ 3@@ 30 million in damage every year , on average , for the past three decades .
and , of course , this average does not include the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma c@@ atastrophe .
indeed , when compared to other energy sources , nuclear power rank@@ s higher than oil , coal , and natural gas systems in terms of f@@ at@@ ali@@ ties , second only to hy@@ dro@@ electri@@ c dam@@ s .
there have been 5@@ 7 ac@@ ci@@ dents since the C@@ her@@ no@@ by@@ l disaster in 198@@ 6 .
while only a few involved f@@ at@@ ali@@ ties , those that did collec@@ tively killed more people than have died in commercial US air@@ line ac@@ ci@@ dents since 198@@ 2 .
another inde@@ x of nuclear @-@ power ac@@ ci@@ dents - this one including costs beyond death and property damage , such as in@@ ju@@ red or ir@@ radi@@ ated workers and mal@@ func@@ tions that did not result in sh@@ ut@@ dow@@ ns or le@@ ak@@ s - do@@ cum@@ ented 9@@ 5@@ 6 inci@@ dents from 194@@ 2 to 2007 .
and yet another do@@ cum@@ ented more than 3@@ 0,000 mi@@ shap@@ s at US nuclear @-@ power pl@@ ants alone , many with the potential to have caused serious m@@ elt@@ dow@@ ns , between the 197@@ 9 ac@@ ci@@ dent at Th@@ re@@ e Mi@@ le Is@@ land in Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania and 2009 .
mistak@@ es are not limited to re@@ ac@@ tor si@@ tes .
ac@@ ci@@ dents at the sav@@ ann@@ ah Ri@@ ver re@@ proc@@ ess@@ ing plant rele@@ ased ten times as much radi@@ o Â­ i@@ od@@ ine as the ac@@ ci@@ dent at Th@@ re@@ e Mi@@ le Is@@ land , and a fire at the Gul@@ f United faci@@ lity in New York in 197@@ 2 sc@@ at@@ tered an un@@ dis@@ closed amount of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um , forcing the plant to sh@@ ut down perman@@ ently .
at the Ma@@ yak Industri@@ al re@@ proc@@ ess@@ ing Com@@ ple@@ x in Russia &apos;s southern Ur@@ als , a stor@@ age t@@ ank holding nit@@ rate ac@@ et@@ ate sal@@ ts explo@@ ded in 195@@ 7 , rele@@ asing a massive amount of radi@@ o@@ active material over 20@@ ,000 squ@@ are kil@@ om@@ e@@ ters , forcing the ev@@ ac@@ uation of 27@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
in September 1994 , an explo@@ sion at Indonesia &apos;s Ser@@ p@@ ong research re@@ ac@@ tor was trig@@ ger@@ ed by the ig@@ ni@@ tion of meth@@ an@@ e gas that had se@@ ep@@ ed from a stor@@ age room and explo@@ ded when a wor@@ ker li@@ t a ci@@ ga@@ ret@@ te .
ac@@ ci@@ dents have also occurred when nuclear re@@ actors are sh@@ ut down for refu@@ eling or to move spent nuclear fuel into stor@@ age .
in 1999 , oper@@ ators lo@@ ad@@ ing spent fuel into dr@@ y @-@ stor@@ age at the Tro@@ j@@ an Re@@ ac@@ tor in O@@ re@@ g@@ on found that the protec@@ tive z@@ in@@ c @-@ carbon co@@ ating had started to produce hy@@ dro@@ gen , which caused a small explo@@ sion .
unfortunately , on@@ - Â­ si@@ te ac@@ ci@@ dents at nuclear re@@ actors and fuel faci@@ lities are not the only cause of concern .
the August 2003 bl@@ ack@@ out in the nor@@ the@@ astern US reve@@ aled that more than a do@@ zen nuclear re@@ actors in the US and Can@@ ada were not proper@@ ly maintaining back@@ up dies@@ el gener@@ ators .
in O@@ n@@ t@@ ario during the bl@@ ack@@ out , re@@ actors de Â­ signed to un@@ lin@@ k from the gri@@ d automati@@ cally and remain in stand@@ by mo@@ de instead went into full sh@@ ut@@ down , with only two of t@@ wel@@ ve re@@ a@@ c Â­ tors be@@ having as expected .
as environmental law@@ yers Rich@@ ard We@@ b@@ ster and Ju@@ lie Le@@ Men@@ se argued in 2008 , &quot; the nuclear industry ... is like the financial industry was pri@@ or to the crisis &quot; that er@@ up@@ ted that year . &quot; &#91; T &#93; here are many risks that are not being proper@@ ly managed or regul@@ ated . &quot;
this state of affairs is wor@@ r@@ ying , to say the least , given the sever@@ ity of har@@ m that a single serious ac@@ ci@@ dent can cause .
the m@@ elt@@ down of a 500 @-@ me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t re@@ ac@@ tor loc@@ ated 30 mi@@ les from a city would cause the immediate death of an estimated 4@@ 5@@ ,000 people , in@@ j@@ ure roughly another 7@@ 0,000 , and cause $ 17 billion in property damage .
a successful attack or ac@@ ci@@ dent at the Indian Po@@ int power plant near New York City , appar@@ ently part of Al Qaeda &apos;s origin@@ al plan for September 11 , 2001 , would have resul@@ ted in 4@@ 3,@@ 7@@ 00 immediate f@@ at@@ ali@@ ties and 5@@ 18@@ ,000 cancer deaths , with cle@@ an@@ up costs reaching $ 2 trillion .
to put a serious ac@@ ci@@ dent in context , according to data from my for@@ th@@ coming book con@@ te@@ sting the F@@ uture of Nu@@ clear Power , if 10 million people were ex@@ posed to radi@@ ation from a complete nuclear m@@ elt@@ down ( the con@@ tain@@ ment structures fail comple@@ t@@ ely , ex@@ posing the inn@@ er re@@ ac@@ tor core to air ) , about 10@@ 0,000 would die from ac@@ ute radi@@ ation si@@ ck@@ ness within six weeks .
about 5@@ 0,000 would experience ac@@ ute bre@@ ath@@ less@@ ness , and 2@@ 4@@ 0,000 would develop ac@@ ute hy@@ po@@ th@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m .
about 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 mal@@ es would be tempor@@ arily st@@ eri@@ le , 10@@ 0,000 women would stop men@@ stru@@ ating , and 10@@ 0,000 children would be born with co@@ gni@@ tive defici@@ en@@ cies .
there would be thousands of sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous abor@@ tions and more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 later canc@@ ers .
advoc@@ ates of nuclear energy have made considerable political head@@ way around the world in recent years , tou@@ ting it as a safe , cle@@ an , and reli@@ able alternative to fossil fuels .
but the historical record clearly shows otherwise .
perhaps the un@@ fol@@ ding tra@@ ge@@ dy in Japan will finally be enough to stop the nuclear ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance from materi@@ ali@@ zing .
the Dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance of Europe
Brussels - W@@ hat will it mean to be European 25 years from now ?
unlike the United States , whose history as a &quot; mel@@ ting po@@ t &quot; has given Americans a truly multi @-@ ethnic charac@@ ter , n@@ ative Europeans are becoming an end@@ ang@@ ered speci@@ es .
Europe b@@ adly needs immigrants , yet is not cul@@ tur@@ ally prepared to wel@@ come them . the coming decades will therefore see substanti@@ ally greater social change in Europe than elsewhere , although the nature of that change is far from clear .
at first gl@@ ance , much of Europe &apos;s current debate is about political and economic integration - about how far its nation states should go in po@@ ol@@ ing resources and sovereign powers in the European Union . but bene@@ ath the sur@@ face , the real tensions are about immigration and fears that national &quot; cul@@ tures &quot; are threat@@ ened by the influ@@ x of non @-@ n@@ atives , both whi@@ te and non @-@ whi@@ te .
immigration in Europe today is running at a higher rate than in the US , with almost two million people arri@@ ving offici@@ ally every year , together with an un@@ known number of illegal immigrants .
the most conservative estim@@ ate , by Euro@@ st@@ at , the EU &apos;s statisti@@ cal agen@@ cy , pu@@ ts the total number of new@@ com@@ ers to Europe between now and 2050 at 40 million . inevit@@ ably , that s@@ ort of influ@@ x will ensure that Europe &apos;s already vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous right @-@ wing extremi@@ st politicians win even greater support .
the spec@@ ter of rising ra@@ cial tensions is wor@@ r@@ ying enough . but it is just one asp@@ ect of Europe &apos;s urg@@ ent need to im@@ port people from Africa and Asia .
Europeans will also see the dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling of their welfare states and social security systems ; the ch@@ eri@@ shed &quot; European model &quot; of pen@@ sions , he@@ al@@ th@@ care , and unemployment benefits risks being re@@ placed by the des@@ p@@ is@@ ed and widely fe@@ ared &quot; American model . &quot;
this is not , ne@@ ed@@ less to say , because Europeans cra@@ ve the ri@@ g@@ ors of America &apos;s less co@@ s@@ set@@ ed social conditions , but because it &apos;s the only way that European governments will be able to sta@@ y af@@ lo@@ at finan@@ ci@@ ally .
the ro@@ ot cause of all these developments is Europe &apos;s population shr@@ in@@ k@@ age .
the &quot; demographi@@ c time bom@@ b &quot; that economic analy@@ sts have been discus@@ sing for a decade or more is now explo@@ ding .
the result is widespread labor shor@@ ta@@ ges in many EU countries and an al@@ arm@@ ing reduction in the propor@@ tion of working @-@ age people whose taxes pay the pen@@ sions and medical costs of those who have reti@@ red .
many countries have themselves ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ated the problem , either by encoura@@ ging early reti@@ rement or - as with France - through job @-@ creation no@@ stru@@ ms like the 35 @-@ h@@ our working week .
about one @-@ third of m@@ ale workers in Europe qu@@ it their jobs by their early fif@@ ties .
that , together with two gener@@ ations in which bir@@ th rates across Europe have dro@@ pped well below the two @-@ children @-@ per @-@ cou@@ ple re@@ plac@@ ement rate , and what the European Commission descri@@ bes as &quot; spec@@ tac@@ ular &quot; increases in l@@ on@@ ge@@ v@@ ity , means that by 2050 , instead of four workers supporting each reti@@ re@@ e , there will be only two .
in short , European policymakers are in an impossible position .
the political min@@ d@@ set in most EU countries remains fir@@ m@@ ly focused on unemployment as the chief ill to be cu@@ red , whereas the real threat is the wor@@ sen@@ ing shor@@ tage of people to fi@@ ll job v@@ ac@@ an@@ cies .
the European Commission has war@@ ned that this will put a lower c@@ ei@@ ling on GDP growth rates .
according to Kl@@ aus Re@@ g@@ ling , the Commission &apos;s Di@@ rec@@ tor @-@ General for Economic and Financial A@@ ff@@ air@@ s , Europe &apos;s working population has so shr@@ un@@ k that from 2010 on@@ ward ma@@ xim@@ um annual economic growth in west@@ ern Europe will drop to 1.@@ 8 % , from an average of 2.@@ 3 % in recent years , and to just 1.@@ 3 % a year from 2030 .
economic stag@@ nation on this scale has al@@ arm@@ ing implications , because it means less and less tax revenues to fund all the reform projects and infra@@ structural investments Europe b@@ adly needs to re@@ gain its productivity and high @-@ te@@ ch competitive ed@@ ge .
and if things look bad for Western Europe , they &apos;@@ re worse for the EU &apos;s form@@ er@@ ly communist new@@ com@@ ers , whose demographi@@ c trends imp@@ ly that average potential growth will no@@ se@@ di@@ ve from today &apos;s healthy 4.@@ 3 % per year to just 0.@@ 9 % after 2030 .
much of Europe already su@@ ff@@ ers from under @-@ per@@ forming labor markets in which job se@@ ek@@ ers and would @-@ be employ@@ ers either can &apos;t or won &apos;t find one another .
stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly high y@@ outh unemployment , along with Europe &apos;s d@@ win@@ d@@ ling numbers of school @-@ lea@@ vers , is already canc@@ eling out the positive effects of immigration . here in Brussels , where the largely North African im@@ migr@@ ant population com@@ pri@@ ses a quarter of the city &apos;s in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants , h@@ ot@@ els and rest@@ au@@ r@@ ants recently res@@ or@@ ted to an emer@@ gency on @-@ line rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ment service to counter their wor@@ sen@@ ing st@@ af@@ f shor@@ ta@@ ges .
the man@@ power crisis is even more ac@@ ute in sectors that demand greater skills and quali@@ fic@@ ations .
like the US , Europe &apos;s man@@ power @-@ related difficul@@ ties are acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ated by the rise of India and China .
how Europeans , and to a less@@ er extent Americans , will maintain their high standards of living is anyone &apos;s gu@@ ess .
but Europe &apos;s problem is greater , for its politicians are at a loss to co@@ pe with the high @-@ vol@@ tage issues of ra@@ ce , religion , and ethni@@ city in societies that seem determined to remain an@@ cho@@ red in the past .
the Dis@@ appe@@ aring Sk@@ y
some months ago , an American a@@ str@@ on@@ aut ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally let a to@@ ol escap@@ e into or@@ bit , e@@ lic@@ iting concern about its ha@@ z@@ ar@@ d@@ ous potential as a hur@@ t@@ ling ob@@ ject that could destro@@ y an expensive sat@@ el@@ li@@ te or even thre@@ aten lives al@@ oft .
shor@@ tly after@@ wards , China ble@@ w up one of its sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es , immediately doub@@ ling the type of fin@@ e or@@ bit@@ ing de@@ bri@@ s that is dangerous because it is hard to tra@@ ck .
once again the world became aw@@ are of the str@@ ange situation emerging in our sk@@ ies .
the sky is a uni@@ que dom@@ ain , and one that is in@@ adequ@@ ately regul@@ ated .
with the adv@@ ent of global pollu@@ tions and technologies , re@@ me@@ d@@ ying this is becoming an increasingly urg@@ ent problem .
in most cases , the laws for sk@@ ies mi@@ r@@ ror those govern@@ ing the world &apos;s oc@@ e@@ ans .
oc@@ e@@ ans bel@@ ong to everyone exc@@ ept those near land@@ m@@ asses , which are managed in a similar man@@ ner to the country &apos;s land @-@ bound borders .
as a result , the sky is usually conc@@ ep@@ tu@@ alized in terms of tra@@ ffi@@ c .
A@@ ir@@ lin@@ ers and figh@@ ter plan@@ es operate in &quot; controlled &quot; air close to the ground , while nation@@ ality is supposed to matter less the higher you go .
fragi@@ le tre@@ ati@@ es that co@@ ver this are en@@ forced mostly by the fact that few nations can afford to place assets that high .
but lat@@ ely , more complex problems are beginning to ari@@ se from human@@ ity &apos;s sharing the at@@ mo@@ sphere .
carbon and flu@@ or@@ o@@ car@@ b@@ ons aff@@ ect everyone &apos;s children .
when C@@ her@@ no@@ by@@ l explo@@ ded , it was not Ukraine alone that inher@@ ited gener@@ ations of radi@@ o@@ active effects .
soon nations will coloni@@ ze the mo@@ on , giving rise to the same uns@@ atis@@ fac@@ tory and tent@@ ative situation we have in An@@ tar@@ cti@@ ca , where nations essen@@ tially take without leg@@ ally ow@@ ning .
a more en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed approach to shared resources is needed , one less dependent on ne@@ o @-@ coloni@@ al control .
some suggest that sky governance follow the preced@@ ent set by the elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic spec@@ tru@@ m .
the &quot; air@@ wa@@ ves &quot; are used for a vari@@ ety of communic@@ ations , including government use and public access like radi@@ o .
the range of us@@ able territory - the spec@@ tru@@ m - is administ@@ ered by governments as though it were real estate , and is bro@@ ken up according to wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ th , with an amount ap@@ por@@ tioned for c@@ ell ph@@ ones , other b@@ its for military p@@ il@@ ots , and so on .
this situation would be disa@@ stro@@ us if it could not be clo@@ sely managed , because people would bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast on top of one another .
soon , we will see the spec@@ tru@@ m become even more active , with the mer@@ ger of c@@ ell ph@@ one infrastructure and the relatively un@@ regul@@ ated Internet .
this will likely be followed by more s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated means of communic@@ ations based on access to the air .
to some extent , everyone will benefit from this , because governments will be less able to c@@ ens@@ or information .
but would it be a better model of at@@ mo@@ sph@@ eri@@ c administration ?
perhaps not .
the problem is that at least some elec@@ tro@@ ma@@ g@@ ne@@ tic wa@@ ves are dangerous .
consider this : at any given moment , the average citi@@ zen in the developed world has billions of mess@@ ages pass@@ ing through his or her bra@@ in .
it can be shown that c@@ ells are able to de@@ t@@ ect these mess@@ ages , but the extent to which they aff@@ ect the body is un@@ known .
however , it is known that be@@ es are d@@ ying in the nor@@ thern he@@ mi@@ sphere .
this is a major concern because so much food depends on be@@ es for pol@@ lin@@ ation .
the primary causes of this recent epide@@ mi@@ c are ger@@ ms and mit@@ es , but these have always been with us .
so why are they aff@@ ec@@ ting be@@ es now ?
a German study suggests that the pro@@ liferation of c@@ ell ph@@ one to@@ wers is weak@@ ening be@@ es &quot; imm@@ un@@ e systems ( the study cor@@ rel@@ ates to@@ wers and sign@@ al strength to be@@ e deaths ) .
the j@@ ury is still out , but it may be that there is no safe level of ex@@ pos@@ ure to many common radi@@ ations ; the more we are ex@@ posed , the more damage we do .
we would see the result of this in indi@@ rec@@ t effects , such as growing rates of as@@ th@@ ma and hy@@ per@@ activity in children .
so perhaps the problem with existing regulatory models lies in the assu@@ mption that the entire at@@ mo@@ sphere is available for un@@ constra@@ ined use .
we have an in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive understanding of the importance of limits when the loss of our sky is arti@@ cul@@ ated in po@@ e@@ tic terms .
as light pollu@@ tion co@@ vers more of the planet , we are losing one of our ol@@ dest connec@@ tions to nature : the an@@ ci@@ ent ability to ga@@ ze at the st@@ ars .
if d@@ ying be@@ es do not in@@ sp@@ ire formal gui@@ del@@ ines about how the sky should be shared , let us hope that emp@@ ty space will .
the sky must bel@@ ong to the people .
ab@@ use of it har@@ ms everyone , and profits from its use should benefit all as well , im@@ pl@@ ying the need to establish worldwide democratic rights over what is an un@@ argu@@ ably universal resource .
the dis@@ cre@@ et Terror of Fi@@ del C@@ a@@ str@@ o
this spr@@ ing mark@@ s the third anni@@ vers@@ ary of the wa@@ ve of repres@@ sion in which Fi@@ del C@@ a@@ str@@ o &apos;s regime ar@@ re@@ sted and hand@@ ed down long sent@@ ences to 75 leading C@@ u@@ ban dis@@ sidents .
soon after@@ wards , many fri@@ ends and I formed the International Committee for Demo@@ cracy in C@@ uba .
the bra@@ very of those who found their social con@@ science , over@@ came fear , and stood up to communist dictator@@ ship remains f@@ res@@ h in my mem@@ ory .
it re@@ min@@ ds me of the j@@ ing@@ le of ke@@ ys that r@@ ang out on Pra@@ gue &apos;s W@@ en@@ c@@ es@@ l@@ as S@@ qu@@ are -@@ - and later around the rest of what was then C@@ z@@ ech@@ o@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia -@@ - in the au@@ tum@@ n of 1989 .
this is why I r@@ ang ke@@ ys during the conference call@@ ing for democracy in C@@ uba that our commit@@ tee held in Pra@@ gue three years ago .
I wanted to dra@@ w the international community &apos;s attention to the human @-@ rights situation in C@@ uba , to support that country &apos;s opposition , and to encourage all pro @-@ democratic forces .
the European Union then introduc@@ ed diplomatic sanctions , al@@ beit mostly symboli@@ c , against C@@ a@@ str@@ o &apos;s regime .
soon after , however , a contrary position came to the fore .
the EU open@@ ed a dialogue with the C@@ u@@ ban regime , sanctions were condi@@ tion@@ ally sus@@ pen@@ ded , and it was even made clear to dis@@ sidents that they were not wel@@ come at the em@@ bas@@ si@@ es of several democratic countries .
co@@ war@@ dly compromise and political ali@@ b@@ is - as so often in history - defe@@ ated a principl@@ ed position .
in return , the C@@ u@@ ban regime made a sha@@ m gest@@ ure by rele@@ asing a small number of the prison@@ ers of con@@ science - mostly those who were tor@@ tured and seriously ill - who the regime most fe@@ ared would die in its not@@ ori@@ ous pri@@ s@@ ons .
those of us who live in Europe &apos;s new post @-@ communist democracies experienced similar political de@@ als when we li@@ ved behind the former Ir@@ on C@@ ur@@ tain .
we are also extrem@@ ely fami@@ li@@ ar with the argument that European policies have not led to any mass ar@@ re@@ sts in C@@ uba .
but democracy has shown weak@@ ness and the C@@ u@@ ban regime has in turn adap@@ ted its tac@@ tics .
resp@@ ected organizations like Re@@ por@@ ters without Bor@@ ders and Am@@ ne@@ st@@ y International have collec@@ ted ample evidence of violence and in@@ timi@@ d@@ ation against fre@@ eth@@ in@@ king C@@ ub@@ ans , who can expect a different kind of ring than that from j@@ ang@@ ling ke@@ ys .
their cases often do not end in cour@@ ts but in ho@@ spit@@ als .
groups of &quot; figh@@ ters for the revolution &quot; - in reality , the C@@ u@@ ban sec@@ ret police - bru@@ t@@ ally attack their political opponents and acc@@ use them of ab@@ sur@@ d crimes in an effort to in@@ timi@@ d@@ ate them or to force them to emi@@ gr@@ ate .
on the is@@ land , such plann@@ ed har@@ ass@@ ments are called &quot; ac@@ to@@ s de re@@ pu@@ di@@ o &quot; - &quot; acts of re@@ jec@@ tion . &quot;
political violence that cre@@ ates the im@@ pression of m@@ ere stre@@ et crime is never easy to prove , unlike j@@ ail terms of several years , and therefore it does not receive due attention from the world .
however , thousands of former political prison@@ ers in central and e@@ astern Europe can att@@ est to the fact that a ki@@ ck from a sec@@ ret poli@@ c@@ em@@ an on the stre@@ et hur@@ ts just as much as a ki@@ ck from a War@@ den behind pri@@ son g@@ ates .
the power@@ less@@ ness of the victi@@ m of state @-@ organi@@ zed stre@@ et fi@@ ghts and threats against his family is experienced in the same way as the power@@ less@@ ness of some@@ body har@@ ass@@ ed during a state security investi@@ g@@ ation .
many European politicians who have sought to see the situation on the ground have been bar@@ red in recent years .
some Europeans appar@@ ently regard C@@ uba as a f@@ ar@@ away country whose f@@ ate they need take no interest in , because they have problems of their own .
but what C@@ ub@@ ans are en@@ during today is part of our own European history .
who better than Europeans , who brought commun@@ ism to life , expor@@ ted it to the world , and then paid de@@ arly for it over many decades , know better about the tor@@ ments inf@@ lic@@ ted upon the C@@ u@@ ban people ?
human@@ ity will pay the price for commun@@ ism until such a time as we learn to stand up to it with all political responsibility and deci@@ si@@ veness .
we have many opportunities to do so in Europe and C@@ uba .
and it is no surprise that the new member countries of the EU have brought to Europe f@@ res@@ h historical experience , and with it far less understanding for and toler@@ ance of conc@@ ession and compromise .
represent@@ atives of the EU &apos;s member states will meet in Brussels in mid @-@ June to re@@ view a common policy towards C@@ uba .
European diplom@@ ats should wei@@ gh up the consequences of ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ating C@@ a@@ str@@ o &apos;s regime .
they should show that they will neither ignor@@ e his practices nor neg@@ lec@@ t the suffering of C@@ u@@ ban prison@@ ers of con@@ science .
we must never for@@ get the seem@@ ingly an@@ on@@ ym@@ ous victims of C@@ a@@ str@@ o &apos;s &quot; acts of re@@ jec@@ tion . &quot;
the Di@@ se@@ ases of Global W@@ arm@@ ing
today few scientists doubt that E@@ ar@@ th &apos;s at@@ mo@@ sphere is warming .
most also agree that the rate of he@@ ating is acceler@@ ating and that the consequences could become increasingly dis@@ rup@@ tive .
even scho@@ ol@@ children can re@@ ci@@ te some pro@@ jected outcomes : oc@@ e@@ ans will war@@ m and gl@@ aci@@ ers will m@@ elt , causing se@@ a levels to rise and s@@ alt water to in@@ und@@ ate low @-@ lying co@@ ast@@ al areas . regions su@@ itable for farm@@ ing will shift .
but less fami@@ li@@ ar effects of global war@@ m@@ ing@@ --@@ nam@@ ely , serious human medical dis@@ or@@ der@@ s@@ --@@ are no less wor@@ ri@@ some .
many are already upon us .
most directly , global warming is pro@@ jected to double the number of deaths related to he@@ at wa@@ ves by 2020 .
pro@@ long@@ ed he@@ at can increase smo@@ g and the disp@@ er@@ s@@ al of all@@ er@@ gen@@ s , causing resp@@ ir@@ atory sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s .
global warming also boo@@ sts the frequ@@ ency and intensi@@ ty of f@@ loo@@ ds and d@@ rou@@ ghts .
such disa@@ sters not only cause death by dro@@ w@@ ning or star@@ v@@ ation , but also damage c@@ rop@@ s and make them vulnerable to inf@@ ection and inf@@ est@@ ations by p@@ ests and cho@@ king we@@ e@@ ds , thereby contribu@@ ting to food shor@@ ta@@ ges and mal@@ nut@@ ri@@ tion .
they disp@@ l@@ ace entire populations , leading to over@@ crow@@ ding and associated diseases , such as tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis .
developing coun@@ tri@@ es@@ --@@ where resources to prevent and tre@@ at inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases are s@@ car@@ ce@@ --@@ are most vulnerable to other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases associated with climate change as well .
but advanced nations , too , can fall victi@@ m to surprise att@@ ack@@ --@@ as happened last year when the first out@@ break of West Ni@@ le vi@@ rus in North America killed seven New Yor@@ kers .
international commer@@ ce and tra@@ v@@ el enable inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases to stri@@ ke contin@@ ents away from their sources .
of course , not all the human health consequences of global warming may be bad .
very high tem@@ perat@@ ures in ho@@ t regions may reduce s@@ n@@ ail populations , which have a role in trans@@ mit@@ ting sch@@ ist@@ o@@ som@@ i@@ a@@ sis , a par@@ asi@@ tic disease .
high win@@ d@@ s@@ --@@ caused by par@@ ching of the ear@@ th &apos;s sur@@ fac@@ e@@ --@@ may disp@@ er@@ se pollu@@ tion .
war@@ mer w@@ inter@@ s in norm@@ ally chil@@ ly areas may reduce c@@ old @-@ related heart attacks and resp@@ ir@@ atory ail@@ ments .
overall , however , the un@@ desi@@ rable effects of more vari@@ able and extreme we@@ a@@ ther are likely to over@@ sha@@ do@@ w any benefits .
diseases re@@ la@@ yed by mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es@@ --@@ malaria , den@@ gue fe@@ ver , y@@ el@@ low fe@@ ver , and several kin@@ ds of en@@ c@@ ep@@ ha@@ li@@ ti@@ s@@ --@@ are e@@ lic@@ iting particularly gra@@ ve concern as the world war@@ ms .
these dis@@ or@@ ders are pro@@ jected to become increasingly pre@@ valent because c@@ old we@@ a@@ ther limits mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es to se@@ as@@ ons and regions with certain minim@@ um tem@@ perat@@ ures .
extreme he@@ at also limits mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to survi@@ val .
but within their survi@@ v@@ able range of tem@@ perat@@ ures , mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es pro@@ lifer@@ ate faster and bi@@ te more as the air becomes war@@ mer .
greater he@@ at also spe@@ e@@ ds the rate at which pa@@ tho@@ gen@@ s in@@ side them re@@ produce and mat@@ ure .
the im@@ mat@@ ure malaria par@@ asi@@ te takes 2@@ 6 days to develop fully at 6@@ 8 degre@@ es F , but only 13 days at 7@@ 7 degre@@ es F@@ . The A@@ no@@ p@@ hel@@ es mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es that spread malaria live only several weeks , so war@@ mer tem@@ perat@@ ures enable more par@@ asi@@ tes to mat@@ ure in time for the mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es to transfer the inf@@ ection .
as whole areas he@@ at up , mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es enter form@@ er@@ ly for@@ bi@@ d@@ den territ@@ ories , bringing ill@@ ness with them , while causing more disease for longer peri@@ ods in the areas they already in@@ hab@@ it .
malaria has already re@@ turned to the Korean pen@@ insu@@ la , and parts of the US , southern Europe and the former Soviet Union have experienced small out@@ break@@ s .
some models project that by the end of this century , the zone of potential malaria trans@@ mission will con@@ tain about 60 % of the world &apos;s population , up from 45 % now .
similarly , den@@ gue ( or &quot; break@@ b@@ one &quot; ) fe@@ ver@@ --@@ a severe fl@@ u @-@ like vi@@ ral ill@@ ness that can cause f@@ at@@ al internal ble@@ ed@@ ing@@ --@@ has bro@@ a@@ den@@ ed its range in the Ameri@@ c@@ as over the past 10 years , reaching down to Bu@@ en@@ os A@@ i@@ res by the end of the 1990 &apos;s .
( it has also found its way to nor@@ thern Australia . )
today it aff@@ lic@@ ts an estimated 50 @-@ 100 million people in the tro@@ pi@@ cs and sub@@ tro@@ pi@@ cs .
these out@@ break@@ s , of course , cannot be tra@@ ced conclu@@ sively to global warming .
other fac@@ tor@@ s@@ --@@ dec@@ lines in mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to @-@ control and other public health programs , or rising drug and p@@ esti@@ cide resist@@ anc@@ e@@ --@@ could be involved .
but the case for a c@@ lim@@ ati@@ c cause becomes stronger when out@@ break@@ s co@@ inci@@ de with other pro@@ jected consequences of global warming .
such is the case in the world &apos;s high@@ lands .
in the 19@@ th century , European coloni@@ sts in Africa sett@@ led in the co@@ ol@@ er moun@@ ta@@ ins to escap@@ e the dangerous s@@ w@@ amp air ( &quot; mal aria &quot; ) in the low@@ lands .
today many of those ha@@ v@@ ens are com@@ promised .
as anti@@ cip@@ ated , war@@ m@@ th is c@@ lim@@ bing up many moun@@ ta@@ ins .
since 1970 , the el@@ ev@@ ation at which tem@@ perat@@ ures are always below free@@ zing has as@@ cen@@ ded almost 500 fe@@ et in the tro@@ pi@@ cs .
in@@ sec@@ t @-@ bor@@ ne inf@@ ec@@ tions are being repor@@ ted at high el@@ ev@@ ations in South and Central America , Asia , and e@@ ast and central Africa .
more d@@ rou@@ ghts and f@@ loo@@ ds due to global warming will also probably fuel out@@ break@@ s of water @-@ bor@@ ne diseases .
parado@@ xi@@ cally , d@@ rou@@ ghts can favor water @-@ bor@@ ne dise@@ as@@ es@@ --@@ including ch@@ ol@@ era , a cause of severe di@@ arr@@ he@@ a@@ --@@ by wi@@ p@@ ing out supp@@ lies of safe drin@@ king water , concent@@ r@@ ating con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ants , and prev@@ enting good hy@@ gi@@ ene .
lack of cle@@ an water also limits safe re@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a or fe@@ ver suffer@@ ers .
f@@ loo@@ ds , meanwhile , w@@ as@@ h se@@ wage and fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zer into water supp@@ lies , trig@@ gering expan@@ sive blo@@ oms of harm@@ ful al@@ ga@@ e that are either directly to@@ xi@@ c to hum@@ ans , or con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ate the fi@@ sh and sh@@ ell@@ fi@@ sh that hum@@ ans consu@@ me .
the human health tol@@ l taken by global warming will depend to a large extent on us .
effective surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance of climate conditions and of the emer@@ gence or res@@ ur@@ gence of inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases ( or their car@@ ri@@ ers ) should be a global priority , as should providing pre@@ ven@@ tive measures and treat@@ ments to at @-@ risk populations .
but we must also limit human activities that contribute to at@@ mo@@ sph@@ eri@@ c he@@ ating , or that exac@@ erb@@ ate its effects .
little doubt remains that bur@@ ning fossil fuels contribu@@ tes to global warming by spe@@ wing carbon dio@@ xi@@ de and other he@@ at @-@ absor@@ bing , or &quot; gre@@ enh@@ ouse , &quot; g@@ ases into the air .
analysis of tre@@ e r@@ ings identi@@ fi@@ es fossil fuels as the source of the 30 % increase in gre@@ enh@@ ouse g@@ ases over pre @-@ industrial levels .
cle@@ aner energy sources must be adopted , while fore@@ sts and w@@ et@@ lands must be pre@@ served and re@@ sto@@ red to absor@@ b carbon dio@@ xi@@ de , and to absor@@ b f@@ loo@@ d@@ wat@@ ers and fil@@ ter con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ants before they reach water supp@@ lies .
none of this will come che@@ ap .
but human@@ ity will pay a far de@@ ar@@ er price for in@@ action .
the Di@@ se@@ ases of Glob@@ alization
globalization is under stra@@ in as never before .
everywhere its st@@ res@@ ses ru@@ m@@ ble .
most of su@@ b @-@ Sah@@ aran Africa , South America , the Middle East , and Central Asia are mi@@ red in stag@@ nation or economic decline .
North America , Western Europe , and Japan are bo@@ gg@@ ed down in slow growth and risk rene@@ wed recession .
war now be@@ ck@@ ons in Iraq .
for advoc@@ ates of open markets and free trade this experience poses major challenges .
why is globalization so at risk ?
why are its benefits seem@@ ingly concent@@ r@@ ated in a few loc@@ ations ?
can a more balanced globalization be achieved ?
no easy ans@@ wers to these questions exist .
open markets are necessary for economic growth , but they are hardly sufficient .
some regions of the world have done extrem@@ ely well from globalization - not@@ ably East Asia and China in recent years .
yet some regions have done mis@@ er@@ ably , especially su@@ b @-@ Sah@@ aran Africa .
the US Govern@@ ment pre@@ ten@@ ds that most problems in poor countries are of their own making .
Africa &apos;s slow growth , say American leaders , is caused by Africa &apos;s poor governance .
life , however , is more complic@@ ated than the Bush Administration belie@@ ves .
consider Africa &apos;s best govern@@ ed countries - G@@ han@@ a , T@@ anz@@ ania , Mal@@ aw@@ i , G@@ ambi@@ a .
each experienced falling living standards over the past two decades while many countries in Asia that r@@ ank lower on international compar@@ is@@ ons of governance - Pakistan , Banglades@@ h , Myanmar and S@@ ri L@@ ank@@ a - experienced better economic growth .
the truth is that economic performance is determined not only by governance standards , but by geo@@ politics , geo@@ gra@@ ph@@ y , and economic structure .
countries with large populations , and h@@ ence large internal markets , tend to grow more rapidly than countries with small populations .
( like all such economic tenden@@ cies , there are counter@@ exam@@ ples ) .
co@@ ast@@ al countries tend to out@@ per@@ form land@@ lock@@ ed countries .
countries with high levels of malaria tend to en@@ dur@@ e s@@ lower growth than countries with lower levels of malaria .
developing countries that neighb@@ or rich markets , such as Mexico , tend to out@@ per@@ form countries far away from major markets .
these differences matter .
if rich countries don &apos;t pay he@@ ed to such structural issues , we will find that the g@@ aps between the world &apos;s winn@@ ers and los@@ ers will continue to wi@@ den .
if rich countries blame un@@ lu@@ ck@@ y countries - claim@@ ing that they are som@@ eh@@ ow cul@@ tur@@ ally or politically un@@ fit to benefit from globalization - we will create not only deeper po@@ ck@@ ets of poverty but also deep@@ ening un@@ rest .
this , in turn , will result in increasing levels of violence , bac@@ klas@@ h , and yes , terrorism .
so it &apos;s time for a more serious approach to globalization than rich countries , especially America , offer .
it should begin with the most urg@@ ent task - meeting the basic needs of the world &apos;s poorest pe@@ op@@ les .
in some cases their suffering can be alle@@ vi@@ ated mainly through better governance within their countries .
but in others , an hon@@ est look at the evidence will reve@@ al that the basic causes are disease , c@@ lim@@ ati@@ c instability , poor so@@ ils , di@@ stances from markets , and so for@@ th .
an hon@@ est ap@@ pra@@ is@@ al would further show that the poorest countries are unable to raise sufficient funds to solve such problems on their own .
rather than rich countries giving more lec@@ tures about poor governance , real solutions will require that rich countries give sufficient financial assistance to overcome the deeper barriers .
one illu@@ stration makes the case vi@@ vi@@ dly . contro@@ lling disease requires a health system that can deliver life @-@ saving medic@@ ations and basic pre@@ ven@@ tive services such as bed @-@ n@@ ets to fight malaria and vit@@ am@@ ins to fight nut@@ ri@@ tional defici@@ en@@ cies .
such a system costs , at the least , around $ 40 per person per year .
that &apos;s a tin@@ y amount of money for rich countries , which ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely spend over $ 2000 per person per year for health , but it is a su@@ m out of reach for poor countries like Mal@@ aw@@ i , with annual incomes of $ 200 per person .
a func@@ tioning health system would cost more than its entire government revenue !
even if Mal@@ aw@@ i is well govern@@ ed , its people will die of disease in large numbers unless Mal@@ aw@@ i recei@@ ves adequate assistance .
successful globalization requires that we think more like doc@@ tors and less like pre@@ ach@@ ers .
rather than cas@@ tig@@ ating the poor for their &quot; sin@@ s , &quot; we should make care@@ ful diagno@@ ses , as a good doc@@ tor would , for each country and region - to understand the fundamental factors that ret@@ ard economic growth and development .
in some regions , such as the An@@ des and Central Asia , the problem is prim@@ arily geo@@ graphi@@ cal isol@@ ation .
here the task is to build ro@@ ads , air lin@@ ks , and inter@@ net connec@@ tivity to help these dist@@ ant regions create productive ties with the world .
rich countries must help finance these projects .
in su@@ b @-@ Sah@@ aran Africa , the basic challenges are disease control , so@@ il fer@@ ti@@ lity , and exp@@ anded educ@@ ational opportunities .

the Dis@@ mal Econ@@ om@@ ist &apos;s jo@@ y@@ less Tri@@ ump@@ h
new YORK - I have long been forec@@ ast@@ ing that it was only a matter of time before America &apos;s housing bubble - which began in the early days of this decade , supported by a flo@@ od of liquidity and la@@ x regulation - would po@@ p .
the longer the bubble exp@@ anded , the larger the explo@@ sion and the greater ( and more global ) the resulting down@@ turn would be@@ .@@ amp@@ nbsp ;
economists are good at identi@@ fying underlying forces , but they are not so good at tim@@ ing .
the dynami@@ cs are , however , much as anti@@ cip@@ ated .
America is still on a down@@ ward tra@@ jec@@ tory for 2009 - with gra@@ ve consequences for the world as a whole .
for example , as their tax revenues pl@@ um@@ met , state and local governments are in the process of cutting back their expendi@@ tures .
American exports are about to decline .
consumer spending is pl@@ um@@ m@@ eting , as expected .
there has been an enormous de@@ cre@@ ase in ( perceived ) wealth , in the trilli@@ ons , with the decline in house and stock prices .
be@@ sides , most Americans were living beyond their means , using their hous@@ es , with their blo@@ ated values , as coll@@ ater@@ al .
that game is up@@ .@@ amp@@ nbsp ;
America would be facing these problems even if it were not si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously facing a financial crisis .
America &apos;s economy had been super@@ char@@ ged by excessive le@@ ver@@ aging ; now comes the pain@@ ful process of del@@ ever@@ aging .
excessive le@@ ver@@ aging , combined with bad lending and risk@@ y deri@@ v@@ atives , has caused credit markets to free@@ ze .
after all , when banks don &apos;t know their own balance she@@ ets , they aren &apos;t about to trust others . &quot; amp@@ nbsp ;
the Bush administration did@@ n &apos;t see the problems coming , deni@@ ed that they were problems when they came , then mini@@ mi@@ zed their signific@@ ance , and , finally , p@@ ani@@ ck@@ ed .
gui@@ ded by one of the arch@@ it@@ ects of the problem , H@@ ank Pau@@ l@@ son , who had advoc@@ ated for der@@ e@@ gul@@ ation and allowing banks to take on even more le@@ ver@@ aging , it was no surprise that the administration ve@@ ered from one policy to another - each strategy supported with absolute con@@ vi@@ ction , until min@@ utes before it was aband@@ oned for another .
even if confidence really were all that mat@@ tered , the economy would have sun@@ k .
moreover , what little action has been taken has been aimed at shor@@ ing up the financial system .
but the financial crisis is only one of several crises facing the country : the underlying macroeconomic problem has been made worse by the sin@@ king fortun@@ es of the bottom half of the population .
those who would spend don &apos;t have the money , and those with the money aren &apos;t spending .
America , and the world , is also facing a major structural problem , not unlike that at the beginning of the last century , when productivity increases in agri@@ culture meant that a rapidly declining share of the population could find work there .
nowadays , increases in manufacturing productivity are even more im@@ pres@@ sive than they were for agri@@ culture a century ago ; but that means the adjust@@ ments that must be made are all the greater .
not long ago , there was discussion of the dang@@ ers of a dis@@ or@@ der@@ ly un@@ win@@ ding of the global economy &apos;s massive imbalances .
what we are se@@ eing today is part of that un@@ win@@ ding .
but there are equally fundamental changes in the global balances of economic power : the ho@@ ards of li@@ qui@@ d money to help ba@@ il out the world lie in Asia and the Middle East , not in West .
but global institutions do not reflect these new reali@@ ties .
globalization has meant that we are increasingly inter@@ dependent .
one cannot have a deep and long down@@ turn in the world &apos;s largest economy without global ra@@ mi@@ fic@@ ations .
I had long argued that the no@@ tion of dec@@ ou@@ pl@@ ing was a my@@ th ; the evidence now cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ates that view .
this is especially so because America has expor@@ ted not just its recession , but its failed der@@ e@@ gul@@ atory philosop@@ h@@ y and to@@ xi@@ c mortg@@ ages , so financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere are also confron@@ ting many of the same pro@@ ble@@ m@@ s@@ .@@ amp@@ nbsp ;
many in the developing world have benef@@ ited great@@ ly from the last boom , through financial flows , exports , and high commodity prices .
now , all of that is being rever@@ sed .
indeed , it is the ultim@@ ate ir@@ ony that money is now f@@ low@@ ing from poor and well @-@ managed economies to the US , the source of the global problems .
the point of rec@@ iting these challenges facing the world is to suggest that , even if Obama and other world leaders do everything right , the US and the global economy are in for a difficult period .
the question is not only how long the recession will last , but what the economy will look like when it emerg@@ es .
will it return to robu@@ st growth , or will we have an an@@ emi@@ c recovery , Ã  la Japan in the 1990 &quot; s ?
right now , I c@@ ast my vote for the lat@@ ter , especially since the huge debt leg@@ acy is likely to damp@@ en enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m for the big stimulus that is required .
without a suffici@@ ently large stimulus ( in excess of 2 % of GDP ) , we will have a vi@@ cious negative spi@@ ral : a weak economy will mean more bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies , which will push stock prices down and interest rates up , undermine consumer confidence , and weak@@ en banks .
consumption and investment will be cut back further .
many Wall Street finan@@ ci@@ ers , having received their go@@ bs of cash , are re@@ turning to their fiscal religion of low deficits .
it is remark@@ able how , having pro@@ ven their in@@ comp@@ et@@ ence , they are still re@@ vered in some quar@@ ters .
what matters more than deficits is what we do with money ; borrowing to finance high @-@ productivity investments in education , technology , or infrastructure strength@@ ens a nation &apos;s balance she@@ et .
the finan@@ ci@@ ers , however , will argue for cau@@ tion : let &apos;s see how the economy does , and if it needs more money , we can give it .
but a firm that is forced into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy is not un @-@ bank@@ rup@@ ted when a course is rever@@ sed .
the damage is long @-@ la@@ st@@ ing@@ .@@ amp@@ nbsp ;
if Obama follow@@ s his inst@@ inc@@ t , pa@@ ys attention to Ma@@ in Street rather than Wall Street , and acts bol@@ dly , then there is a prospect that the economy will start to emer@@ ge from the down@@ turn by late 2009 .
if not , the short @-@ term prospects for America , and the world , are ble@@ ak .
the Dis@@ sident and the Mah@@ at@@ ma
new D@@ E@@ L@@ H@@ I - W@@ ith the Nobel Pe@@ ace Pri@@ ze pres@@ ented this month in the absence of this year &apos;s lau@@ re@@ ate , the im@@ prison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u X@@ i@@ a@@ ob@@ o , it might be wise to think of a man who never won the pri@@ ze : Mah@@ at@@ ma G@@ and@@ hi .
despite that om@@ is@@ sion , there is no doub@@ ting G@@ and@@ hi@@ j@@ i &apos;s worldwide signific@@ ance - including for Li@@ u .
the Mah@@ at@@ ma &apos;s ima@@ ge now feat@@ ures in ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing campaig@@ ns for everything from App@@ le compu@@ ters to Mon@@ t B@@ lan@@ c pen@@ s .
when Rich@@ ard At@@ ten@@ bor@@ ough &apos;s fil@@ m G@@ and@@ hi s@@ we@@ p@@ t the O@@ sc@@ ars in 198@@ 3 , post@@ ers for the fil@@ m proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed that &quot; G@@ and@@ hi &apos;s tri@@ ump@@ h changed the world fore@@ ver . &quot; but did it ?
the case for G@@ and@@ hi @-@ led global change re@@ sts princip@@ ally on the American civil @-@ rights leader Mar@@ tin Lu@@ ther K@@ ing , J@@ r . , who atten@@ ded a lec@@ ture on G@@ and@@ hi , b@@ ought a half @-@ do@@ zen boo@@ ks about the Mah@@ at@@ ma , and adopted sat@@ y@@ ag@@ ra@@ h@@ a as both prec@@ ept and meth@@ od .
in leading the struggle to break down se@@ gre@@ g@@ ation in the southern United States , K@@ ing used non @-@ violence more effectively than anyone else outside India . &quot; h@@ ate be@@ gets h@@ ate .
violence be@@ gets violence , &quot; he mem@@ or@@ ably declared . &quot; we must meet the forces of h@@ ate with sou@@ l force . &quot;
K@@ ing later avo@@ wed that &quot; the G@@ and@@ hi@@ an meth@@ od of non @-@ violent resistance ... became the gui@@ ding light of our movement .
Chri@@ st fur@@ ni@@ shed the spiri@@ t and motiv@@ ation , and G@@ and@@ hi fur@@ ni@@ shed the meth@@ od . &quot; last month , Barack Obama told India &apos;s Parliament that were it not for G@@ and@@ hi , he would not be standing there as America &apos;s president .
so , yes , G@@ and@@ hi@@ sm helped to change America fore@@ ver .
but it is difficult to find many other in@@ stances of its success .
India &apos;s independence mark@@ ed the da@@ wn of the era of dec@@ ol@@ oni@@ zation , but many nations thre@@ w off the yo@@ ke of emp@@ ire only after b@@ loo@@ dy and violent strugg@@ les .
other pe@@ op@@ les have since fallen under the bo@@ ots of inv@@ ad@@ ing ar@@ mi@@ es , been dis@@ pos@@ s@@ essed of their lands , or terrori@@ zed into fle@@ eing their homes .
non @-@ violence has offered no solutions to them .
indeed , non @-@ violence could only work against opponents vulnerable to a loss of moral authority - that is , governments respon@@ sive to domestic and international public opinion , and thus cap@@ able of being sh@@ am@@ ed into conc@@ e@@ ding defeat .
in G@@ and@@ hi &apos;s own time , non @-@ violence could have done nothing to prevent the s@@ lau@@ gh@@ ter of Je@@ ws in Hit@@ ler &apos;s path .
the power of G@@ and@@ hi@@ an non @-@ violence re@@ sts in being able to say , &quot; T@@ o show you that you are wrong , I pun@@ ish my@@ self . &quot; but that has little effect on those who are not interest@@ ed in whether they are wrong and are already seeking to pun@@ ish you .
your willingness to under@@ go puni@@ shment merely ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tes their victory .
no won@@ der N@@ el@@ son M@@ andel@@ a , who told me that G@@ and@@ hi had &quot; always been a great source of in@@ spi@@ ration , &quot; exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly disa@@ vo@@ wed non @-@ violence as ine@@ ff@@ ective in South Afri@@ cans &quot; struggle against ap@@ ar@@ thei@@ d .
indeed , G@@ and@@ hi can sound fri@@ ghten@@ ingly un@@ reali@@ stic : &quot; the willing s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of the in@@ no@@ cent is the most powerful answer to in@@ sol@@ ent ty@@ r@@ ann@@ y that has yet been conc@@ ei@@ ved by G@@ od or man . di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence , to be &quot; civil , &quot; must be sin@@ c@@ ere , resp@@ ec@@ t@@ ful , re@@ stra@@ ined , never de@@ fi@@ ant , and it must have no ill will or hat@@ red behind it .
neither should there be exc@@ it@@ ement in civil di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence , which is a pre@@ par@@ ation for mu@@ te suffering . &quot;
for many around the world who suffer under op@@ pres@@ sive regimes , such a cre@@ do would sound like a pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for sa@@ in@@ tho@@ od - or for im@@ poten@@ ce .
mu@@ te suffering is fin@@ e as a moral principle , but only G@@ and@@ hi could use it to bring about mean@@ ing@@ ful change .
the sad truth is that the sta@@ ying power of organi@@ zed violence is almost always greater than that of non @-@ violence .
G@@ and@@ hi believed in &quot; we@@ an@@ ing an opp@@ on@@ ent from er@@ ror by pati@@ ence , sym@@ pa@@ thy , and self @-@ suffering . &quot; but , while such an approach may have won Burma &apos;s A@@ ung S@@ an Su@@ u K@@ y@@ i the Nobel that el@@ u@@ ded the Mah@@ at@@ ma himself , the violence of the Bur@@ m@@ ese state proved far stronger in prev@@ enting change than her suffering has in f@@ om@@ enting it .
and , as the M@@ um@@ ba@@ i terror attacks of November 2008 demonstrated , India today faces the threat of cross @-@ border terrorism to which the Mah@@ at@@ ma &apos;s only answer - a fast in prot@@ est - would have left its per@@ pet@@ r@@ ators un@@ mo@@ ved .
in his internation@@ alism , the Mah@@ at@@ ma ex@@ pressed ide@@ als that few can re@@ ject .
but the decades since his death have con@@ fir@@ med that there is no escap@@ ing the conflic@@ ting sover@@ eign@@ ties of states .
some 20 million lives have been lost in wars and insur@@ rec@@ tions since G@@ and@@ hi died .
in a dis@@ ma@@ ying number of countries , including his own , India , governments spend more for military pur@@ poses than for education and health care combined .
the current sto@@ ck@@ pi@@ le of nuclear weapons represents more than a million times the explo@@ sive power of the bom@@ b whose destruction of Hi@@ ro@@ shi@@ ma so g@@ rie@@ ved him .
outside India , as within it , G@@ and@@ hi@@ an techni@@ qu@@ es have been per@@ ver@@ ted by terrorists and bom@@ b @-@ thro@@ wers who dec@@ l@@ are h@@ unger stri@@ kes when puni@@ shed for their crimes .
G@@ and@@ hi@@ sm without moral authority is like Mar@@ x@@ ism without a pro@@ let@@ ari@@ at .
yet too few who have tried his meth@@ ods worldwide have had his personal integri@@ ty or moral stat@@ ure .
none of these mis@@ gui@@ ded or cy@@ ni@@ cal efforts has di@@ l@@ ut@@ ed G@@ and@@ hi &apos;s great@@ ness , or the extra@@ ordinary res@@ on@@ ance of his life and his message .
while the world was disin@@ te@@ gr@@ ating into fas@@ cism , violence , and war , the Mah@@ at@@ ma tau@@ ght the vir@@ tu@@ es of truth , non @-@ violence , and peace .
he destro@@ yed the credibility of coloni@@ alism by op@@ posing principle to force .
and he set and at@@ tained personal standards of con@@ vi@@ ction and coura@@ ge that few will ever mat@@ ch .
he was that r@@ are kind of leader who was not con@@ fin@@ ed by his fol@@ lo@@ wers &quot; in@@ adequ@@ aci@@ es .
yet G@@ and@@ hi &apos;s truth was essen@@ tially his own .
he form@@ ul@@ ated its uni@@ que con@@ tent and determined its app@@ lic@@ ation in a specific historical context .
inevit@@ ably , few in today &apos;s world can measure up to his great@@ ness or asp@@ ire to his cre@@ do .
the origin@@ ality of G@@ and@@ hi &apos;s thought and the example of his life still in@@ sp@@ ire people around the world today - as Li@@ u X@@ i@@ a@@ ob@@ o would re@@ adi@@ ly ad@@ mit .
but his tri@@ ump@@ h did not &quot; change the world fore@@ ver . &quot;
I won@@ der if the Mah@@ at@@ ma , sur@@ ve@@ ying today &apos;s world , would feel that he had tri@@ um@@ ph@@ ed at all .
the dist@@ ance Bet@@ ween the Fir@@ st and T@@ hi@@ r@@ d Rom@@ e
Moscow / R@@ O@@ M@@ E : for a decade , Pop@@ e John Paul II has been fl@@ ying in cir@@ cles around M@@ other Russia : one day he visi@@ ts the Bal@@ tics or his hom@@ el@@ and of Poland ; the next , Or@@ thodo@@ x Rom@@ ania and Georgia .
in June , 2001 Pop@@ e John Paul II will visit Ukraine and Ar@@ men@@ ia , both parts of the former Soviet Union and both still wat@@ ched over war@@ i@@ ly by Russia &apos;s Or@@ thodo@@ x Chur@@ ch .
K@@ aro@@ l Wo@@ j@@ ty@@ la , the first S@@ la@@ vi@@ c Pop@@ e in history , has long dre@@ am@@ ed of visi@@ ting Moscow ; indeed he may see such a visit as putting the fini@@ shing tou@@ ch on his long , tur@@ bul@@ ent pon@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
but , a decade after commun@@ ism &apos;s collapse , it is Russia &apos;s ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ men , not its politicians , who are blo@@ cking the way .
from K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v on@@ ward , Moscow &apos;s ru@@ lers e@@ yed the V@@ ati@@ can sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ ously but not without interest .
Kremlin leaders inst@@ inc@@ tively understood the benefits of nor@@ mali@@ sing relations with the H@@ ol@@ y Se@@ e for Soviet pro@@ paganda and foreign policy , and me@@ et@@ ings between the Pop@@ e and An@@ drei Gro@@ my@@ ko and Ni@@ kol@@ ai Po@@ d@@ gor@@ n@@ y did take place .
not until 1989 , however , did Mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il G@@ or@@ b@@ ach@@ e@@ v d@@ are establish official relations with the V@@ ati@@ can , inv@@ iting Pop@@ e John Paul II to visit the Soviet Union .
Bor@@ is Y@@ elt@@ sin repe@@ ated the inv@@ it@@ ation in 1991 , and Vladimir Putin did the same on his visit to Rom@@ e soon after his in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration as Russia &apos;s president .
no pap@@ al visit to Moscow has taken place , however , because Russia &apos;s Or@@ thodo@@ x Chur@@ ch remains op@@ posed .
the Russian Or@@ thodo@@ x attitu@@ de is vo@@ i@@ ced repe@@ ate@@ dly by Pat@@ ri@@ arch Ale@@ x@@ y II and his clos@@ est ai@@ des , including the Pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ y &apos;s &quot; foreign minister , &quot; M@@ et@@ ro@@ poli@@ tan K@@ y@@ ri@@ ll .
before the announ@@ cement of the Pap@@ al visit to Ukraine , the Italian newspap@@ er &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ era d@@ ell@@ a Ser@@ a &quot; quot@@ ed Pat@@ ri@@ arch Ale@@ x@@ y II as ad@@ mit@@ ting that a pap@@ al visit was possible , but only if &quot; per@@ sec@@ ution &quot; of Russian Or@@ thodo@@ x@@ y by C@@ atholi@@ cs in west@@ ern Ukraine and pro@@ sel@@ y@@ ti@@ sing by C@@ atholi@@ c cl@@ erg@@ y on the &quot; can@@ oni@@ c territory &quot; of the Russian Or@@ thodo@@ x ch@@ ur@@ ch came to an end .
although seem@@ ingly har@@ d@@ line , these two conditions are a step forward for the Pat@@ ri@@ arch from his not@@ ori@@ ous stat@@ ement of a few years ago , when he said that a true Or@@ thodo@@ x Christi@@ an must not even pi@@ ck mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms in the same fo@@ rest as a C@@ atholi@@ c .
the Soviet Union , the Communist Party of the US@@ S@@ R , and the K@@ G@@ B may have collap@@ sed , but the Russian Or@@ thodo@@ x Chur@@ ch still defen@@ ds the s@@ ac@@ red borders of the former Russian emp@@ ire .
moreover , because almost half of the par@@ i@@ sh@@ es over@@ seen by the Moscow Pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ ate are abroad - in Ukraine , Bel@@ ar@@ us , M@@ ol@@ do@@ va , Central Asia and other regions - Pat@@ ri@@ arch Ale@@ x@@ y II la@@ ys increasing st@@ ress on the global charac@@ ter of his ch@@ ur@@ ch .
indeed , the Russian Chur@@ ch &apos;s arch@@ bi@@ sh@@ ops pres@@ ented their Pat@@ ri@@ arch a g@@ ol@@ den i@@ c@@ on , one side of which de@@ pi@@ c@@ ted the L@@ ast S@@ up@@ per and the other a ma@@ p of his vast can@@ oni@@ cal territory , to mark the tent@@ h anni@@ vers@@ ary of his rei@@ g@@ n .
clearly , all the bo@@ ws and pla@@ in@@ tive &quot; M@@ E@@ A cul@@ p@@ as &quot; made by the Pop@@ e over the past year to mark the 200@@ 0@@ th anni@@ vers@@ ary of the B@@ ir@@ th of Chri@@ st , have not satis@@ fied the Pat@@ ri@@ arch .
so , s@@ adly , the P@@ on@@ ti@@ ff &apos;s dre@@ am of step@@ p@@ ing on Russian so@@ il , a so@@ il la@@ vi@@ sh@@ ly sho@@ wer@@ ed with the blo@@ od of mar@@ ty@@ r@@ s , before what the Pop@@ e has called this ter@@ ri@@ ble &quot; w@@ ol@@ ver@@ ine &quot; century comes to an end , may never come true .
opportunities for a meeting between the two ch@@ ur@@ ch leaders still exist , of course .
for example , in 2001 both the C@@ atholi@@ c and Or@@ thodo@@ x E@@ ast@@ er will fall on the same day - 15 April - an extrem@@ ely r@@ are oc@@ curren@@ ce .
what better pre@@ text could there be for an ec@@ um@@ en@@ i@@ cal meeting ?
but will the Pat@@ ri@@ arch sei@@ ze the moment ?
the w@@ oun@@ ds between the two ch@@ ur@@ ches would he@@ al if left un@@ dist@@ ur@@ bed .
I will never for@@ get how two old men - the Pop@@ e and 90 @-@ year old Ac@@ ade@@ mi@@ ci@@ an D@@ mi@@ try Li@@ k@@ ha@@ che@@ v - le@@ af@@ ed through a r@@ are book together with te@@ ars in their e@@ yes .
Li@@ k@@ ha@@ che@@ v was sho@@ wing the Pop@@ e an al@@ bu@@ m about the S@@ olo@@ v@@ et@@ s@@ y c@@ amp where Li@@ k@@ ha@@ che@@ v had been im@@ prison@@ ed for &quot; religious pro@@ paganda . &quot;
the al@@ bu@@ m con@@ tained ph@@ ot@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ s of the win@@ do@@ ws of the old mon@@ k &apos;s c@@ ells to which the Sovi@@ ets had af@@ fi@@ xed b@@ ars ; for years these c@@ ells im@@ prison@@ ed C@@ atholi@@ c cl@@ erg@@ y@@ men , such as those ar@@ re@@ sted after State Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or Ni@@ kol@@ ay K@@ r@@ y@@ len@@ ko proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed the C@@ atholi@@ c Chur@@ ch &quot; an en@@ emy of the people &quot; in 19@@ 17 .
no one in authority in Russia , however , has ever rep@@ ented for crimes committed against the country &apos;s own people .
the hier@@ arch@@ y of the Russian Or@@ thodo@@ x Chur@@ ch , indeed , has not ad@@ mit@@ ted the sin@@ s of its coll@@ abor@@ ation with the Soviet state .
such a &quot; M@@ E@@ A cul@@ p@@ a &quot; from Russia might also help begin to he@@ al the w@@ oun@@ ds of the C@@ atholi@@ c / Or@@ thodo@@ x divi@@ sion .
ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement between Christi@@ ans is today a moral and political im@@ per@@ ative .
the Pop@@ e made the first step in a meeting last spr@@ ing with Pat@@ ri@@ arch S@@ hen@@ u@@ da I@@ II of the C@@ op@@ tic Or@@ thodo@@ x Chur@@ ch during the Pop@@ e &apos;s visit to the H@@ ol@@ y land .
John Paul II hin@@ ted , dar@@ ingly , at the possibility of revi@@ sing the thous@@ and @-@ year old principle of the Bi@@ sho@@ p of Rom@@ e being first of the a@@ post@@ les and Chri@@ st &apos;s Vi@@ c@@ ar on ear@@ th .
since 10@@ 5@@ 4 , this idea has been a primary obstac@@ le to Christi@@ an unity .
according to the Kremlin press service , President Putin speak@@ s to Pat@@ ri@@ arch Ale@@ x@@ y II often . perhaps he should explain to him that failure to pursue ra@@ p@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with the V@@ ati@@ can contra@@ dic@@ ts Russia &apos;s state interests .
for the Kremlin and the V@@ ati@@ can see e@@ y@@ e to e@@ y@@ e on many problems , including the Middle East . as Russia &apos;s strugg@@ les to find a role and a vo@@ ice in world diplomacy , having the H@@ ol@@ y Se@@ e as an ally would be bene@@ fi@@ cial .
&quot; the te@@ ars of this century la@@ id the ground for a new spr@@ ing of the human spiri@@ t , &quot; the Pop@@ e declared in his last visit to the UN .
Russia , as everyone knows , has suffer@@ ed as much as , if not more than , any country .
s@@ adly , as the ti@@ tle from one of Russia &apos;s most bel@@ o@@ ved mo@@ vi@@ es of the communist era t@@ ells us , it still seems that &quot; Moscow ( or at least its Pat@@ ri@@ arch ) does not believe in te@@ ars . &quot;
the Dis@@ un@@ iting Kingdom ?
three hund@@ red years after the first S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh Parliament vol@@ unt@@ arily voted itself out of exist@@ ence in 17@@ 0@@ 7 , the S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh National Party has won a plu@@ ra@@ lity in the de@@ vol@@ ved S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh parliament that is one of T@@ ony Blair &apos;s great leg@@ aci@@ es .
does an S@@ N@@ P @-@ led government her@@ al@@ d the break @-@ up of the United Kingdom ?
more bro@@ adly , does nationalism , that product of n@@ inet@@ e@@ enth @-@ century politics , still have a role to play in Europe ?
the answer to the first question is almost certainly no .
nationalist po@@ lled only 3@@ 1.@@ 9 % of the vot@@ es c@@ ast with parties supporting the union poll@@ ing 5@@ 9@@ .@@ 6 % .
pro@@ of positive that propor@@ tional represent@@ ation can produce str@@ ange outcomes .
back in 195@@ 7 , the mo@@ tive for &quot; la@@ ying the found@@ ations of an ever closer union of the pe@@ op@@ les of Europe &quot; was to make war between European nations ob@@ sol@@ ete , and , in doing so , to bring internal stability to all European nations .
for 50 years , the European Union was not much te@@ sted by this mission because nationalist imp@@ ul@@ ses were c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed between the two great Cold War alli@@ ances .
with those constra@@ ints gone , nationalism in both its B@@ is@@ mar@@ ck@@ ian state @-@ making and ethnic state @-@ break@@ ing gu@@ is@@ es has got@@ ten a second wind .
when people nowadays spe@@ ak of nationalism , sin@@ ist@@ er ima@@ ges from another era come to mind .
but nationalism is , of course , not inevit@@ ably violent : it f@@ la@@ res into conflict only in places with a fl@@ amm@@ able leg@@ acy .
the break @-@ up of the Soviet Union and its sat@@ el@@ li@@ te emp@@ ire shows that the way to address such a leg@@ acy is not to force un@@ happ@@ y pe@@ op@@ les to live together in one country .
it is to recognize that in some places di@@ vor@@ ce is inevitable , and to ensure that it is as ami@@ c@@ able as possible .
the world could not have prev@@ ented Yu@@ gosla@@ via &apos;s spi@@ ral into civil war , but it might have made it less cru@@ el by helping to negoti@@ ate terms of separ@@ ation earlier .
some suggest that the S@@ N@@ P &apos;s acc@@ ession to power in S@@ cot@@ land does her@@ al@@ d the re@@ bir@@ th of a nation , many others regard that claim as rhetoric which ig@@ no@@ res the tre@@ men@@ d@@ ous adv@@ ances made in the quality of life , opportunity and living standards .
if the claim were true it is a re@@ bir@@ th that is coming about in an extra@@ ordinary way .
exc@@ ept for some od@@ d and hap@@ less individuals , there have been no under@@ ground ar@@ mi@@ es , separ@@ ati@@ st terrorists , campaig@@ ns of civil di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence aimed at un@@ se@@ ating governments , or even any mass demon@@ stra@@ tions .
the establishment of a S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh Parliament v@@ est@@ ed with powers de@@ vol@@ ved from the United Kingdom Parliament at West@@ min@@ ster has been perhaps the first revolution of the modern era that was conduc@@ ted by commit@@ te@@ es of law@@ yers , cl@@ erg@@ y@@ men , and accoun@@ t@@ ants rather than c@@ ells of be@@ ar@@ ded ra@@ dic@@ als .
moreover , it was achieved without a sho@@ t being fi@@ red .
so it is not surpri@@ sing that it has also been a revolution that - unlike that which divided C@@ z@@ ech@@ o@@ s@@ lo@@ v@@ ak@@ ia 14 years ago - falls well short of achieving full stat@@ eh@@ o@@ od for S@@ cot@@ land .
the Parliament at West@@ min@@ ster , to which S@@ c@@ ots continue to el@@ ect M@@ P &apos;s , still controls defense and foreign affairs , macroeconomic policy , tax@@ ation , and social security .
the S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh Parliament , however , is able to legisl@@ ate over health services , education , local government , housing , crimin@@ al and civil justice , and economic development .
it can also raise or lower the basic rate of income tax - though by no more than 3 % - and lev@@ y char@@ ges , such as road t@@ oll@@ s .
this sem@@ i @-@ independence partly reflects the absence of ling@@ ui@@ stic mo@@ tives in S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh nationalism , unlike the Qu@@ e@@ be@@ co@@ is of Can@@ ada or F@@ le@@ mis@@ h nationalism in Bel@@ gi@@ um .
G@@ a@@ eli@@ c is spo@@ ken by only about 8@@ 0,000 of S@@ cot@@ land &apos;s 5@@ .@@ 1 million in@@ hab@@ it@@ ants .
nor does religion play a dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble role ; while Rom@@ an C@@ atholi@@ cs used to fear independence as being li@@ able to result in Prote@@ st@@ ant he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y , today C@@ atholi@@ cs and Prote@@ stan@@ ts are roughly equal in their support of S@@ cot@@ land &apos;s institutions .
moreover , unlike East European or Bal@@ kan nationalism , the S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh vari@@ ety has little to do with ethni@@ city or religion .
thus , in S@@ cot@@ land today there are none of the conditions that f@@ om@@ ented re@@ bel@@ li@@ on in Ireland and led to I@@ ris@@ h independence in 19@@ 22 , the last great rup@@ ture in the political union of the British Is@@ les .
S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh nationali@@ sts do look long@@ ingly at Ireland , but for its recent phen@@ om@@ en@@ al economic growth .
for most S@@ c@@ ots , however , the I@@ ris@@ h experience is not an appe@@ aling model - perhaps because it is associated with terrorism .
they also know that the huge financial assistance which Ireland received form the European Union will never be repe@@ ated
what motiv@@ ates S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh nationalism is the strong att@@ ach@@ ment to S@@ cot@@ land &apos;s civi@@ c institutions .
in this respect , S@@ cot@@ land di@@ ff@@ ers from W@@ ales , which was for@@ ci@@ bly inc@@ or@@ por@@ ated into England more than 4@@ 00 years before the S@@ c@@ ots signed the vol@@ unt@@ ary Ac@@ t of Union in 17@@ 0@@ 7 .
distinc@@ tive Wel@@ sh institutions , ap@@ art from those concerned with the Wel@@ sh language , are difficult to identi@@ fy .
by contrast , S@@ cot@@ land &apos;s institutional land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e - schools and universities with their own cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um and ex@@ am structures , a legal system with its own co@@ des and rules , a ch@@ ur@@ ch independent of the state , and a distinc@@ tive system of local government - were left un@@ tou@@ ched by the union .
today &apos;s S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh parliament help@@ s to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate S@@ cot@@ ti@@ sh dis@@ con@@ t@@ ents because it is re@@ vit@@ ali@@ zing those institutions .
but it is also pro@@ p@@ elling British politics into a new and un@@ fami@@ li@@ ar de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zed political system .
West@@ min@@ ster &apos;s wri@@ t no longer r@@ uns nor@@ th of the border , at least as far as things like education and health are concerned .
equally , it is now far har@@ der for S@@ c@@ ots to blame a dist@@ ant government in London for their problems , although the S@@ N@@ P will now try to make bl@@ am@@ ing West@@ min@@ ster for all il@@ ls even more of an art form .
so , far from being a har@@ b@@ ing@@ er of the break @-@ up of Britain , de@@ volution has brought f@@ res@@ h vit@@ ality to national life outside London .
the new confidence in E@@ d@@ in@@ bur@@ gh , which is experi@@ en@@ cing an economic boom , is self @-@ evi@@ dent .
what is ar@@ is@@ ing is a different S@@ cot@@ land , and a different Britain , and this is S@@ cot@@ land &apos;s lesson for Europe .
Britain &apos;s highly cent@@ rali@@ zed political culture has been ir@@ re@@ versi@@ bly changed .
it is being re@@ placed by a more di@@ verse s@@ ort of politics , in which different regional and national identi@@ ties gain encoura@@ gement and ex@@ pression .
by co@@ oper@@ ating with the rest of the United Kingdom , rather than clas@@ h@@ ing , S@@ cot@@ land is giving new mean@@ ing to the ph@@ ra@@ se &quot; ever closer union . &quot;
the bilateral Th@@ re@@ at to Fre@@ e Trade
I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l - The D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und of global trade talks appears to have died this year , almost without a whi@@ mp@@ er .
while a small por@@ tion of the project may be sa@@ ved , the essential reality is that this is a uni@@ que failure in the history of multilateral trade negotiations , which have trans@@ formed the global economy since World War II .
many of the seven previous ro@@ unds of negotiations - including the U@@ ru@@ gu@@ ay Ro@@ und , which resul@@ ted in the establishment of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) in 1995 as the success@@ or to the General A@@ gre@@ ement on Trade and T@@ ari@@ ffs ( G@@ A@@ T@@ T ) - took years to complete , but none died of neg@@ lec@@ t or disin@@ ter@@ est .
today &apos;s indi@@ ffer@@ ence is particularly , though not exclu@@ sively , evi@@ dent in the United States .
President Barack Obama was sil@@ ent on the issue in his re @-@ election campaign , and bre@@ ath@@ ed s@@ car@@ c@@ ely a wor@@ d about it in his first campaign , too .
one won@@ ders whether what is at stak@@ e is even fully understood in some capit@@ als .
successful multilateral trade negotiations have significantly shap@@ ed the world in which we live and have dramatically enh@@ anced the lives of millions of people .
between 19@@ 60 and 1990 , only one person in five li@@ ved in an economically open society ; today , n@@ ine in ten do .
the rule @-@ based trading system developed by the G@@ A@@ T@@ T and the WTO has been embra@@ ced by virtually the entire global community .
it has provided an effective road ma@@ p for the former plann@@ ed and im@@ port @-@ sub@@ stitu@@ ting economies , facilit@@ ating their integration into the global market .
initi@@ ally , &quot; globalization &quot; was a di@@ r@@ ty wor@@ d to some .
but , even among its opponents , its value for poor@@ er countries came to be recognized , as it helped to li@@ ft more than a billion people in Asia out of ab@@ ject poverty .
while much more needs to be done for Africa and parts of Latin America , the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und was intended to as@@ sist in providing market access ( and therefore opportunity ) to many more in the developing world .
the essen@@ ce of the multilateral system consi@@ sts in two principles : non @-@ discrimin@@ ation and national treatment .
the former is descri@@ bed in the trade negoti@@ ators &quot; le@@ xi@@ c@@ on as the ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ most fa@@ vo@@ red nation &quot; principle , which essen@@ tially se@@ eks to ensure that trade benefits provided to one country are provided to all .
the lat@@ ter requires member states to provide the same treatment to trading partners within national borders as that provided to nation@@ als .
the non @-@ discrimin@@ ation principle en@@ su@@ red that global trade did not become a &quot; sp@@ ag@@ h@@ ett@@ i bo@@ w@@ l &quot; of prefer@@ ential bilateral trade agreements .
moreover , a multilateral framework for trade negotiations gave weak@@ er states far more balanced conditions than they would face were they forced to negoti@@ ate bilater@@ ally with the lik@@ es of China , the United States , or the European Union .
in fact , what we have seen in recent years is an increasing r@@ ush to bilateral agreements by the major trading countries and blo@@ cs .
this has appar@@ ently consum@@ ed virtually all of their attention .
the WTO has been margin@@ alized , and even what has already been achieved in the in@@ complete D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und appears unlikely to be deli@@ vered in a final agreement in the fo@@ rese@@ e@@ able future .
the damage to the credibility of the WTO - once lau@@ ded as the greatest advance in global governance since the in@@ spi@@ red institution @-@ building of the immediate post@@ war period - may yet prove la@@ sting .
worse , it could have a serious impact not merely on trade , but on political relation@@ ships more generally .
one of the WTO &apos;s great achie@@ vements has been the adju@@ dic@@ ation system that it provides - the so @-@ called Di@@ sp@@ ute S@@ ett@@ le@@ ment Mechan@@ ism .
this independent body has been a re@@ so@@ und@@ ing success , giving the world an effective qu@@ asi @-@ judi@@ cial system to resolve disp@@ utes between trading partners .
but its continued success depends ultimately on the credibility of the WTO itself ; it will inevit@@ ably suffer coll@@ ater@@ al damage from a failure of multilateral negotiations .
indeed , the current r@@ ush to bilateral trade agreements has been ac@@ compani@@ ed by a rise in protection@@ ism .
for example , there have been 4@@ 24 new measures of this kind in the EU since 2008 .
fur@@ ther@@ more , the EU &apos;s non @-@ discrimin@@ atory tari@@ ffs are fully app@@ lic@@ able to only n@@ ine trading partners .
everyone else has &quot; exc@@ ep@@ tional &quot; treatment .
next , no doubt , we will have the prospect of a bilateral free @-@ trade agreement between the EU and the US .
an EU @-@ Japan treaty is already in the wind , as is a &quot; Tr@@ ans @-@ P@@ aci@@ fic Partner@@ ship &quot; to liber@@ alize trade among the US and major Asian and Latin American economies .
if either ever comes to p@@ ass , which I doubt , a huge share of world trade would be conduc@@ ted within a discrimin@@ atory framework .
some recognize the risks .
in May 2011 , J@@ ag@@ dis@@ h B@@ ha@@ g@@ wat@@ i of Col@@ um@@ bia University and I co @-@ ch@@ ai@@ red a Hi@@ gh Le@@ v@@ el Gro@@ up conven@@ ed by the prime ministers of the United Kingdom , Germany , Turkey , and Indonesia to attempt to move the multilateral process ahead .
our sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors wel@@ com@@ ed our re@@ commen@@ d@@ ations , but that and similar efforts have gained little trac@@ tion , leaving all countries rus@@ h@@ ing head@@ long toward a world full of uncertainty and risk .
it is not too late to re@@ verse the appar@@ ently in@@ ex@@ or@@ able ti@@ de of bilater@@ alism .
but the only way to do so is by proc@@ ee@@ ding with WTO negotiations .
even if the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und cannot be conclu@@ ded , there may be other ro@@ utes , such as implement@@ ing what has already been agreed .
another alternative might be to advance multilateral negotiations among willing countries in specific areas , such as services , with other WTO members jo@@ ining later .
but if we are to move forward rather than rever@@ t to earlier , more dangerous times , the US , in particular , must re@@ ass@@ ert a con@@ structive role in multilater@@ alism .
the US must lead again , as it did in the past .
and now it must do so with China at its side .
the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und &apos;s Pre@@ mat@@ ure ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary
new YORK - The D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und , the first multilateral trade negoti@@ ation conduc@@ ted under the au@@ spi@@ ces of the World Trade Organization , is at a critical stage .
now in their 10@@ th year , with much negoti@@ ated , the talks need a final political nu@@ dge , l@@ est D@@ oh@@ a - and h@@ ence the WTO - dis@@ appear from the world &apos;s ra@@ dar s@@ cre@@ en .
indeed , the danger is already real : when I was in Gen@@ ev@@ a a year ago and sta@@ ying at the up@@ scale Mand@@ ar@@ in O@@ ri@@ ent@@ al , I asked the con@@ ci@@ er@@ ge how far away the WTO was .
he loo@@ ked at me and asked : &quot; is the World Trade Organization a tra@@ v@@ el agen@@ cy ? &quot;
the threat of ir@@ relev@@ ance is understood by leading stat@@ es@@ men , who have committed themselves to putting their sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders to the whe@@ el .
British Prime Minister David Cameron , German Chanc@@ ellor Angela Merkel , and Indone@@ sian President Su@@ sil@@ o B@@ am@@ bang Yu@@ d@@ ho@@ y@@ on@@ o have un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally end@@ or@@ sed the re@@ commen@@ d@@ ation of the Hi@@ gh @-@ level Exper@@ t Gro@@ up on Trade , which P@@ eter Su@@ ther@@ land and I co @-@ ch@@ air , that we ought to aband@@ on the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und if it is not conclu@@ ded by the end of this year .
our idea was that , just as the prospect of an im@@ min@@ ent h@@ ang@@ ing concent@@ rates the mind , the de@@ ad@@ line and prospec@@ tive death of the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und would g@@ al@@ v@@ ani@@ ze the world &apos;s stat@@ es@@ men behind comple@@ ting the last mi@@ le of the mar@@ ath@@ on .
( the an@@ alo@@ gy is all the more appropriate , given that WTO Di@@ rec@@ tor @-@ General P@@ as@@ cal L@@ am@@ y , who has bri@@ lli@@ antly kept the process going , is a mar@@ ath@@ on run@@ ner . )
but even as these efforts are ga@@ ther@@ ing moment@@ um , The Financial Tim@@ es , which used to be a staun@@ ch suppor@@ ter of multilateral free trade , dro@@ pped a c@@ lu@@ ster bom@@ b on D@@ oh@@ a , even con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ating itself that , in 2008 ( when a ministeri@@ al meeting failed to reach clos@@ ure ) , it &quot; argued that leaders should ad@@ mit the negotiations were de@@ ad . &quot; but if skepti@@ cs for@@ get Mar@@ k T@@ wa@@ in &apos;s fam@@ ous response to a mistak@@ en ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary - &quot; The re@@ ports of my death are great@@ ly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated &quot; - were the negoti@@ ators who have continued to work since then ak@@ in to Go@@ go@@ l &apos;s &quot; de@@ ad sou@@ ls ? &quot;
the Financial Tim@@ es re@@ commen@@ ds working out a Plan B here and now , which would s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age the political efforts to conclu@@ de the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und .
despite rhetori@@ cal bro@@ mi@@ des about requ@@ iring &quot; ministers to un@@ learn ing@@ ra@@ ined hab@@ its and focus on subst@@ ance , not rhetoric , &quot; and about &quot; business associ@@ ations eng@@ aging with the gran@@ ular deta@@ il of what companies want , &quot; this proposed Plan B would strengthen the bilateral and regional trade initiatives that have diver@@ ted energy and attention from D@@ oh@@ a and the WTO .
the ir@@ ony here is that the pro@@ liferation of such prefer@@ ential trade agreements ( P@@ T@@ A@@ s ) is usually justi@@ fied by poin@@ ting to the lack of progress in conclu@@ ding the D@@ oh@@ a talks .
never have cause and effect been so dramatically rever@@ sed in argum@@ ents over trade policy .
it has become increasingly obvious that such P@@ T@@ A@@ s are what I call &quot; ter@@ mit@@ es in the trading system . &quot;
indeed , evidence is moun@@ ting that they fo@@ ster harm@@ ful trade di@@ version by increasing discrimin@@ ation against non @-@ members through differ@@ ential use of anti @-@ du@@ mp@@ ing actions .
thus , recent work by the economists To@@ m P@@ rus@@ a and Robert te@@ h has produced convinc@@ ing evidence that anti @-@ du@@ mp@@ ing fil@@ ings de@@ cre@@ ase by 3@@ 3 @-@ 5@@ 5 % within a P@@ T@@ A , whereas such fil@@ ings increase against non @-@ members by 10 @-@ 30 % .
more import@@ antly , P@@ T@@ A@@ s are used by he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic powers to fo@@ ist on weak@@ er trading partners demands un@@ related to trade but desi@@ red by domestic lob@@ bi@@ es , at times in a mark@@ edly asy@@ mm@@ etri@@ c way .
thus , Per@@ u saw its labor legislation virtually re@@ w@@ ritten by United States Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men inde@@ b@@ ted to American uni@@ ons before the US @-@ Per@@ u P@@ T@@ A was conclu@@ ded .
similarly , C@@ lau@@ de Bar@@ field has do@@ cum@@ ented how Col@@ om@@ bia has been in@@ timi@@ d@@ ated into making it a crime ( with pri@@ son terms of up to five years ) to engage in acts that &quot; undermine the right to organi@@ ze and bar@@ gain collec@@ tively . &quot; Col@@ om@@ bia must also p@@ ass a law dic@@ t@@ ating pri@@ son terms for anyone who &quot; offers a collective p@@ act to non @-@ union workers that is sup@@ eri@@ or to terms for union workers . &quot;
will the US administration start fi@@ ling crimin@@ al char@@ ges against the govern@@ or of Wis@@ consi@@ n and the many other Republican leaders who are doing precisely what the Col@@ om@@ bi@@ an government is being bul@@ lied into not doing ?
such over@@ reach is typi@@ cal of what goes on in he@@ gem@@ on @-@ led P@@ T@@ A@@ s , unlike at the WTO , where stronger countries like India ( which asked the European Union to take all non @-@ trade @-@ related measures out of the proposed P@@ T@@ A ) and Brazil cannot be so in@@ timi@@ d@@ ated .
the danger is that over@@ reach will lead civil society and voters in democratic developing countries to re@@ act against self @-@ ser@@ ving disp@@ la@@ ys of he@@ ge@@ mon@@ ic might by jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ing free trade itself , on the assu@@ mption that such open@@ ness is little more than ne@@ o @-@ coloni@@ alism .
the Dollar and the Dra@@ g@@ on
Cambridge - F@@ or several years , American officials have pressed China to re@@ value its currency .
they comp@@ lain that the under@@ valu@@ ed renminbi represents un@@ fair competition , destro@@ ying American jobs , and contribu@@ ting to the United States &quot; trade deficit .
how , then , should US officials respond ?
just before the recent G @-@ 20 meeting in T@@ or@@ on@@ to , China announced a form@@ ula that would allow modest renminbi appreci@@ ation , but some American Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men remain un@@ convinc@@ ed , and thre@@ aten to increase tari@@ ffs on Chinese goods .
America absor@@ bs Chinese imports , pa@@ ys China in dollars , and China hol@@ ds dollars , am@@ ass@@ ing $ 2.@@ 5 trillion in foreign @-@ exchange reserves , much of it held in US Treasury securities .
to some obser@@ vers , this represents a fundamental shift in the global balance of power , because China could bring the US to its k@@ ne@@ es by threat@@ ening to sell its dollars .
but , if China were to bring the US to it k@@ ne@@ es , it might bring itself to its ank@@ les in the process .
China would not only reduce the value of its reserves as the dollar &apos;s value fell , but it would also je@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ ze America &apos;s continued willingness to im@@ port che@@ ap Chinese goods , which would mean job losses and instability in China .
jud@@ ging whether economic inter@@ dependence produ@@ ces power requires looking at the balance of asy@@ mm@@ et@@ ries , not just at one side of the equ@@ ation .
in this case , inter@@ dependence has created a &quot; balance of financial terror &quot; an@@ alo@@ g@@ ous to the Cold War , when the US and the Soviet Union never used their potential to destro@@ y each other in a nuclear exchange .
in Febru@@ ary 2010 , ang@@ ered over American arms s@@ ales to Taiwan , a group of senior military of@@ fic@@ ers called for the Chinese government to sell off US government bonds in reta@@ li@@ ation .
their proposal went un@@ he@@ e@@ ded .
instead , Y@@ i G@@ ang , China &apos;s direc@@ tor of state administration of foreign exchange , expla@@ ined that &quot; Chinese investments in US Treas@@ uries are market investment behavior , and we don &apos;t wish to politici@@ ze them . &quot; otherwise , the pain would be mu@@ tual .
nevertheless , this balance does not guarantee stability .
there is always the danger of actions with un@@ intended consequences , especially as both countries can be expected to man@@ eu@@ ver to change the framework and reduce their vulner@@ abilities .
for example , after the 2008 financial crisis , while the US pressed China to let its currency appreci@@ ate , officials at China &apos;s central bank began argu@@ ing that America needed to increase its savings , reduce its deficits , and move toward sup@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing the dollar &apos;s role as a reser@@ ve currency with IMF @-@ issued special dra@@ wing rights .
but China &apos;s bar@@ k was l@@ ou@@ der than its bi@@ te .
China &apos;s increased financial power may have increased its ability to re@@ sist American ent@@ re@@ ati@@ es , but despite di@@ re predic@@ tions , its credi@@ tor role has not been sufficient to comp@@ el the US to change its policies .
while China has taken min@@ or measures to slow the increase in its dollar @-@ den@@ omin@@ ated hol@@ dings , it has been un@@ willing to risk a fully conver@@ ti@@ ble currency for domestic political reasons .
thus , the renminbi is unlikely to challenge the dollar &apos;s role as the largest comp@@ on@@ ent of world reserves ( more than 60 % ) in the next decade .
yet , as China gradu@@ ally increases domestic consumption rather than rel@@ ying on exports as its eng@@ ine of economic growth , its leaders may begin to feel less dependent than they now are on access to the US market as a source of job creation , which is crucial for internal political stability .
in that case , maintaining a weak renminbi would protect the trade balance from a flo@@ od of imports .
asy@@ mm@@ et@@ ries in currency markets are a particularly important asp@@ ect of economic power , since they under@@ lie global trade and financial markets .
by li@@ mit@@ ing the conver@@ ti@@ bility of its currency , China is avoi@@ ding currency markets &quot; ability to discipl@@ ine domestic economic decisions .
comp@@ are , for example , the discipl@@ ine that international banks and the IMF were able to impose on Indonesia and South Korea in 1998 , with the relative freedom of the US - be@@ sto@@ wed by den@@ omin@@ ation of American debt in dollars - to increase government spending in response to the 2008 financial crisis .
indeed , rather than weak@@ ening , the dollar has appreci@@ ated as investors regard the underlying strength of the US as a safe ha@@ ven .
ob@@ viously , a country whose currency represents a significant propor@@ tion of world reserves can gain international power from that position , th@@ anks to easier terms for economic adjustment and the ability to influence other countries .
as French President Char@@ les de G@@ au@@ lle once comp@@ la@@ ined , &quot; since the dollar is the refer@@ ence currency everywhere , it can cause others to suffer the effects of its poor management .
this is not acceptable . this cannot last . &quot;
but it did .
America &apos;s military and economic strength rein@@ forces confidence in the dollar as a safe ha@@ ven .
as a Can@@ adi@@ an analy@@ st put it , &quot; the combined effect of an advanced capital market and a strong military mach@@ ine to def@@ end that market , and other safety measures , such as a strong tradi@@ tion of property rights protection and a rep@@ ut@@ ation for hon@@ oring du@@ es , has made it possible to attrac@@ t capital with great e@@ ase . &quot;
the G @-@ 20 is foc@@ using on the need to &quot; re @-@ balance &quot; financial flows , al@@ ter@@ ing the old pattern of US deficits mat@@ ching Chinese sur@@ pl@@ uses .
this would require politically difficult shif@@ ts in consumption and investment , with America increasing its savings and China increasing domestic consumption .
such changes do not occur quickly .
neither side is in a hur@@ ry to break the sy@@ mm@@ et@@ ry of inter@@ dependent vulner@@ ability , but both continue to jo@@ ck@@ ey to shape the structure and institutional framework of their market relationship .
for the s@@ ake of the global economy , let us hope that neither side mis@@ calcul@@ ates .
the Dollar H@@ its an O@@ il s@@ li@@ ck
Cambridge - The rapid rise in the price of oil and the sharp de@@ preci@@ ation of the dollar are two of the most not@@ e@@ wor@@ thy developments of the past year .
the price of oil has increased by 8@@ 5 % over the past 12 months , from $ 65 a bar@@ re@@ l to $ 1@@ 20 .
during the same period , the dollar fell by 15 % relative to the euro and 12 % against the y@@ en .
to many obser@@ vers , the combination of a falling dollar and a rise in oil prices appears to be more than a co@@ inci@@ dence .
but what is the lin@@ k between the two ?
would the price of oil have increased less if oil were pri@@ ced in e@@ uro@@ s instead of dollars ?
did the dollar &apos;s fall cause the price of oil to rise ?
and how did the rise in the price of oil aff@@ ect the dollar &apos;s movement ?
because the oil market is global , with its price in different places virtually identi@@ cal , the price reflects both total world demand for oil and total supply by all of the oil @-@ produc@@ ing countries .
the primary demand for oil is as a tran@@ sport fuel , with less@@ er amounts used for he@@ ating , energy , and as in@@ pu@@ ts for pet@@ ro@@ chemi@@ cal industries like pl@@ as@@ tics .
the increasing demand for oil from all countries , but particularly from rapidly growing emerging @-@ market countries like China and India , has therefore been , and will continue to be , an important force push@@ ing up the global price .
the thinking behind the question of whether oil would cost less today if it were pri@@ ced in e@@ uro@@ s seems to be that , since the dollar has fallen relative to the euro , this would have con@@ tained the rise in the price of oil .
in reality , the currency in which oil is pri@@ ced would have no significant or sustained effect on the price of oil when trans@@ l@@ ated into dollars , e@@ uro@@ s , y@@ en , or any other currency .
here is why . the market is now in equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um with the price of oil at $ 1@@ 20 .
that trans@@ l@@ ates into 75 e@@ uro@@ s at the current exchange rate of around $ 1.@@ 60 per euro .
if it were agreed that oil would instead be pri@@ ced in e@@ uro@@ s , the quot@@ ed market @-@ equi@@ li@@ br@@ ating price would still be 75 e@@ uro@@ s and therefore $ 1@@ 20 .
any lower price in e@@ uro@@ s would cause excess global demand for oil , while a price above 75 e@@ uro@@ s would not create enough demand to absor@@ b all of the oil that produc@@ ers wanted to sell at that price .
of course , the rate of increase of the price of oil in e@@ uro@@ s during the past year was lower than the rate of increase in dollars .
the euro price of oil in May 2007 was 4@@ 8 e@@ uro@@ s , or 5@@ 6 % below its current price .
but that would be true even if oil had been pri@@ ced in e@@ uro@@ s .
the co@@ inci@@ dence of the dollar decline and the rise in the oil price suggests to many obser@@ vers that the dollar &apos;s decline caused the rise in the price of oil .
that is only true to the extent that we think about the price of oil in dollars , since the dollar has fallen relative to other major currencies .
but if the dollar @-@ euro exchange rate had remained at the same level that it was last May , the dollar price of oil would have increased less .
the key point here is that the euro price of oil would be the same as it is today .
and the dollar price of oil would have gone up 5@@ 6 % .
the only effect of the dollar &apos;s decline is to change the price in dollars relative to the price in e@@ uro@@ s and other currencies .
the high and rising price of oil does , however , contribute to the decline of the dollar , because the increasing cost of oil imports wi@@ dens the United States &quot; trade deficit .
in 2007 , the US spent $ 3@@ 3@@ 1 billion on oil imports , which was 4@@ 7 % of the US trade deficit of $ 7@@ 0@@ 8 billion dollars .
if the price of oil had remained at $ 65 a bar@@ re@@ l , the cost of the same vol@@ ume of imports would have been only $ 17@@ 9 billion , and the trade deficit would have been one @-@ fif@@ th lower .
the dollar is declining because only a more competitive dollar can shr@@ in@@ k the US trade deficit to a sustainable level .
thus , as rising global demand push@@ es oil prices higher in the years ahead , it will become more difficult to shr@@ in@@ k America &apos;s trade deficit , in@@ duc@@ ing more rapid dollar de@@ preci@@ ation .
the Dollar &apos;s L@@ ast D@@ a@@ ys ?
Cambridge - Z@@ ho@@ u X@@ i@@ a@@ o@@ ch@@ uan , the govern@@ or of the Pe@@ ople &apos;s Bank of China , recently suggest@@ ed that re@@ plac@@ ing the dollar with the International Monetary Fund &apos;s Sp@@ eci@@ al Dra@@ wing Ri@@ ghts as the domin@@ ant reser@@ ve currency would bring greater stability to the global financial system .
the idea of re@@ forming the system by introduc@@ ing a sup@@ ran@@ ational reser@@ ve currency is also , it appears , supported by Russia and other emerging markets .
and a United Nations ad@@ vis@@ ory commit@@ tee ch@@ ai@@ red by the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h S@@ tig@@ lit@@ z has argued for a new global reser@@ ve currency , possibly one based on the SD@@ R .
trans@@ forming the dollar standard into an SD@@ R @-@ based system would be a major break with a policy that has la@@ sted more than 60 years .
the SD@@ R was introduc@@ ed 40 years ago to sup@@ ple@@ ment what was then seen as an in@@ adequate level of global reserves , and was sub@@ sequ@@ ently ens@@ hr@@ ined in the IMF &apos;s am@@ ended Arti@@ cles of A@@ gre@@ ement as the future princip@@ al reser@@ ve asset .
but the world soon became aw@@ as@@ h in dollars .
so , instead of becoming the princip@@ al reser@@ ve asset of the global system , the propor@@ tion of SD@@ R@@ s in global reserves shr@@ ank to a tin@@ y fra@@ ction , ren@@ der@@ ing the SD@@ R the monetary equivalent of E@@ sp@@ er@@ an@@ to .
although the euro , created in 1999 , turned out to be a more serious competi@@ tor to the dollar , its share in total international reserves has probably remained below 30 % , compared to 65 % for the dollar ( these sha@@ res are in part estimates , as China , the world &apos;s largest hol@@ der of reserves , does not report the currency com@@ position of its hol@@ dings ) .
there are two ways in which the dollar &apos;s role in the international monetary system can be reduced .
one possibility is a gradu@@ al , market @-@ determined ero@@ sion of the dollar as a reser@@ ve currency in favor of the euro .
but , while the euro &apos;s international role - especially its use in financial markets - has increased since its inc@@ eption , it is hard to en@@ vi@@ sage it over@@ taking the dollar as the domin@@ ant reser@@ ve currency in the fo@@ rese@@ e@@ able future .
such an outcome is probably only possible if two conditions are met : first , the United Kingdom jo@@ ins the euro area , and , second , the United States makes serious , confidence @-@ s@@ app@@ ing mistak@@ es .
the lat@@ ter condi@@ tion may already have been parti@@ ally met , but US policies to stabili@@ ze its financial system should help avoid a major dollar s@@ li@@ de .
moreover , the European Central Bank has repe@@ ate@@ dly st@@ ated that it neither encoura@@ ges nor dis@@ coura@@ ges the euro &apos;s international role .
with the dollar &apos;s he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y unlikely to be seriously undermin@@ ed by market forces , at least in the short and medium @-@ term , the only way to bring about a major reduction in its role as a reser@@ ve currency is by international agreement .
the Chinese proposal falls into this c@@ ateg@@ ory .
one way to make the SD@@ R the major reser@@ ve currency relatively soon would be to create and alloc@@ ate a massive amount of new SD@@ R@@ s to the IMF &apos;s members .
while the G @-@ 20 leaders have decided to support an SD@@ R alloc@@ ation of $ 2@@ 50 billion , this will increase the share of SD@@ R@@ s in total international reserves to no more than 4 % .
in order to make the SD@@ R the princip@@ al reser@@ ve asset via the alloc@@ ation rou@@ te , close to $ 3 trillion in SD@@ R@@ s would need to be created , an un@@ reali@@ stic pro@@ position .
but there is a more reali@@ stic way for the SD@@ R &apos;s importance to grow .
back in 1980 , the IMF came close to adop@@ ting a so @-@ called SD@@ R sub@@ stitu@@ tion Ac@@ coun@@ t .
the idea was to per@@ mit countries whose official dollar hol@@ dings were larger than they were com@@ fort@@ able with to conver@@ t dollars into SD@@ R@@ s .
conver@@ sion would occur outside the market , and thus would not put down@@ ward pressure on the dollar .
member countries would receive an asset that was more stable than the dollar , as it was based on a bas@@ k@@ et of currencies , thereby providing better protection against losses .
the plan fell ap@@ art when some major IMF share@@ holders could not accept the burden @-@ sharing arrangements that would be necessary in case of losses due to exchange @-@ rate movements .
the US also lost interest in the sch@@ eme as the dollar strength@@ ened .
what are the ch@@ ances of adop@@ ting a sch@@ eme of this kind today ?
is the US prepared to go along with a reform of the international monetary system that redu@@ ces the dollar &apos;s role ?
until recently , I would have considered this unlikely .
but the changed international climate , and the possibility of a b@@ out of severe dollar weak@@ ness , could con@@ vin@@ ce the US to go along with a conver@@ sion sch@@ eme that would alle@@ vi@@ ate excessive pressure on the dollar .
and , ap@@ art from possible political consider@@ ations , large holders of dollars would find a sub@@ stitu@@ tion account attrac@@ tive as a form of protection against strong flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations in the dollar &apos;s value .
what about possible losses suffer@@ ed by the sub@@ stitu@@ tion Ac@@ coun@@ t ? this can be de@@ alt with by setting asi@@ de part of the IMF &apos;s large gold stock .
even if an SD@@ R sub@@ stitu@@ tion Ac@@ coun@@ t is established , it is unlikely that the dollar &apos;s share in international reserves would fall to an in@@ significant level .
the dollar will remain important for many countries as a v@@ ehi@@ cle for intervention in foreign @-@ exchange markets , as well as for inv@@ o@@ i@@ cing and for den@@ omin@@ ating internation@@ ally tra@@ ded securities .
but one can en@@ vi@@ sage a system in which international reserves are held each in roughly equal sha@@ res of dollars , e@@ uro@@ s ( assum@@ ing a further gradu@@ al increase in its share ) , and SD@@ R@@ s .
while there are currently other pri@@ orities , it would be us@@ eful for the IMF to study an@@ ew an SD@@ R sub@@ stitu@@ tion account and similar sch@@ em@@ es .
if it does not , the debate will take place elsewhere .
the Dollar &apos;s L@@ ong Ta@@ il
new D@@ E@@ L@@ H@@ I - The ongoing economic crisis and the per@@ sist@@ ent deficits of the United States have increasingly called into question the dollar &apos;s role as the world &apos;s an@@ ch@@ or currency .
recent mo@@ ves to internation@@ alize China &apos;s renminbi have led to anti@@ cip@@ ation of a lo@@ om@@ ing shift in the global monetary system .
many promin@@ ent economists , including the members of a United Nations pan@@ el head@@ ed by the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate economist Jo@@ se@@ p@@ h S@@ tig@@ lit@@ z , are re@@ commen@@ ding a &quot; Global Reserve System &quot; to re@@ place the dollar &apos;s he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y .
but the long history of global an@@ ch@@ or currencies suggests that the dollar &apos;s days on top may be far from over .
in an@@ ci@@ ent times , India r@@ an a large trade surplus with the Rom@@ an emp@@ ire .
as P@@ lin@@ y w@@ ro@@ te in the first century : &quot; not a year pass@@ ed in which India did not take 50 million se@@ ster@@ ces away from Rom@@ e . &quot; &amp; nbsp ; T@@ hat trade im@@ balance imp@@ lied a continu@@ ous dra@@ in on gold and sil@@ ver co@@ in , causing shor@@ ta@@ ges of these met@@ als in Rom@@ e .
in modern terms , the Rom@@ ans faced a monetary squ@@ ee@@ ze .
Rom@@ e respon@@ ded by reducing the gold / sil@@ ver con@@ tent ( the an@@ ci@@ ent equivalent of mon@@ e@@ ti@@ zation ) , which led to sustained inflation in the emp@@ ire .
but the frequ@@ ent disco@@ very of Rom@@ an co@@ ins in India suggests that Rom@@ an co@@ in@@ age continued to be accepted internation@@ ally long after it must have been obvious that its gold or sil@@ ver con@@ tent had fallen .
in the si@@ x@@ te@@ enth century , Spain emerged as a super@@ power following its con@@ qu@@ est of South America .
between 15@@ 0@@ 1 and 16@@ 00 , 17 million ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of p@@ ure sil@@ ver and 18@@ 1@@ ,000 ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of p@@ ure gold f@@ low@@ ed from the Ameri@@ c@@ as to Spain , which spent the money on wars in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands and elsewhere .
this increase in liquidity caused both an economic boom and inflation across Europe .
despite this wealth , Spain became increasingly inde@@ b@@ ted , eventually def@@ au@@ l@@ ting three times - in 16@@ 0@@ 7 , 16@@ 27 , and 16@@ 4@@ 9 - &amp; nbsp ; and head@@ ing into sharp geopolitical decline .
yet Sp@@ anish sil@@ ver co@@ ins ( known as &quot; pi@@ ec@@ es of eight &quot; or Sp@@ anish dollars ) remained the main currency used in world trade right up to the American Re@@ volution@@ ary War .
in fact , Sp@@ anish co@@ in remained legal ten@@ der in the US until 18@@ 5@@ 7 - long after Spain itself had c@@ eas@@ ed to be a major power .
by the middle of the n@@ inet@@ e@@ enth century , the world was func@@ tioning on a bi @-@ met@@ al system based on gold and sil@@ ver .
but , following the British example , most major countries had shif@@ ted to a gold standard by the 18@@ 70 &quot; s .
the Bank of England stood ready to conver@@ t a po@@ und ster@@ ling into an oun@@ ce of ( 11 / 12 fin@@ e ) gold on demand . that system was dis@@ rup@@ ted by World War I , but Britain went back to a gold pe@@ g in 19@@ 25 .
as the Great Depression took ro@@ ot , however , the Bank of England was forced to choose between providing liquidity to banks and hon@@ oring the gold pe@@ g .
it op@@ ted for the former in 193@@ 1 .
yet po@@ und ster@@ ling continued to be a major world currency until well after World War II .
even as late as 19@@ 50 - more than a half @-@ century after the US had re@@ placed Britain as the world &apos;s largest industrial power - 5@@ 5 % of foreign @-@ exchange reserves were held in ster@@ ling , and many countries continued to pe@@ g their currencies to it .
three things should be clear from this history .
first , a global monetary system based on preci@@ ous met@@ als does not resolve the fundamental imbalances of a global economic system .
second , preci@@ ous met@@ als do not resolve the problem of inflation .
and , finally , the an@@ ch@@ or currency and the underlying ec@@ o @-@ system of world trade often out@@ live the geopolitical decline of the an@@ ch@@ or country by decades .
a new economic order was established after World War II , with the US as the an@@ ch@@ or country .
the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods system linked the US dollar to gold at $ 35 per oun@@ ce , with other currencies linked to the dollar ( though occ@@ asion@@ ally allowed to make adjust@@ ments ) .
the f@@ law in the system was that it under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed global economic expansion for only as long as the US was willing to provide dollars by running up deficits - the same deficits that would eventually undermine America &apos;s ability to maintain the $ 35 / oun@@ ce gold price .
in 196@@ 1 , the US respon@@ ded by creating the London G@@ old po@@ ol , which ob@@ li@@ ged other countries to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se the US for half of its gold losses .
but this arrange@@ ment quickly b@@ red dis@@ con@@ tent , with France leaving the G@@ old po@@ ol in 196@@ 7 .
the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods system collap@@ sed four years later .
or did it ?
despite the problems of the 1970 &quot; s , the dollar remained the world &apos;s domin@@ ant currency , with succ@@ essive gener@@ ations of Asian countries pe@@ gg@@ ing their exchange rates to it .
as with the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods system , a peripher@@ al economy ( for example , China ) could grow very rapidly even as the an@@ ch@@ or economy ( the US ) enjo@@ yed che@@ ap financing .
China &apos;s relative rise did not di@@ min@@ ish the dollar &apos;s role - and may even have enh@@ anced it .
indeed , like the Japanese during their period of rapid growth , the Chinese have , until recently , resist@@ ed internation@@ alization of the renminbi .
so , are we enter@@ ing a post @-@ dollar world ?
despite all of the pain caused by the Great Rec@@ ession , there is no sign that the world is for@@ s@@ ak@@ ing the gre@@ en@@ back .
investors remain willing to finance the US at ro@@ ck @-@ bottom interest rates , and the nomin@@ al trade @-@ wei@@ gh@@ ted inde@@ x of the dollar has not collap@@ sed .
even if China re@@ places the US as the world &apos;s largest economy within a decade , an an@@ ch@@ or currency can be more re@@ sili@@ ent than the economic and geopolitical domin@@ ance of its country of ori@@ gin .
that is why the dollar will most likely remain the domin@@ ant global currency long after the US has been sur@@ pass@@ ed .
the Dollar W@@ ars Ret@@ ur@@ n
faced by un@@ certain re @-@ election prospects , and wor@@ ried about job losses , US President George W. Bush has be@@ gun to blame other countries , sen@@ ding his Treasury Secretary to demand that they raise their exchange rates in order to make foreign goods more expensive for American consumers .
that was John S@@ now &apos;s mission on his recent tri@@ p to China , but his goal was nothing new .
two of S@@ now &apos;s pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors , John Con@@ n@@ ally and J@@ ames B@@ ak@@ er , followed a similar qu@@ est for politically desi@@ rable exchange rates .
what S@@ now asked of China is an od@@ d demand : we do not norm@@ ally go into sto@@ res and ask the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er to raise his prices .
but the emer@@ gence of powerful new currencies always provo@@ kes f@@ res@@ h attemp@@ ts at the use of exchange rates for political pur@@ poses .
for twenty years after W@@ W@@ II , there were just two major international currencies , as there had been through the inter@@ war period : the British po@@ und and the American dollar .
by the end of the 19@@ 60 &apos;s , the po@@ und had been so weak@@ ened that international markets lost interest .
instead , two new major currencies emerged , as the strength of the Japanese and ( West ) German economies produced big trade sur@@ pl@@ uses .
American produc@@ ers and the US government comp@@ la@@ ined that American workers were being pri@@ ced out of jobs because the Y@@ en and D @-@ mark were being held at arti@@ fici@@ ally low levels .
the US government under President Rich@@ ard Ni@@ xon pressed the Ger@@ mans and Japanese to re@@ value their currencies .
the Ger@@ mans did but the Japanese did not , in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating the US Treasury Secretary , who tried his best to bul@@ ly Japan .
John Con@@ n@@ ally comp@@ la@@ ined that Japan had a &quot; controlled economy &quot; and did not play by the rules .
all sides eng@@ aged in mu@@ d@@ sl@@ ing@@ ing about who was doing the most damage to the world economy .
the Americans acc@@ used the Europeans and especially the Japanese of growing too slow@@ ly , while the Europeans and the Japanese argued that the US was expor@@ ting inflation to the rest of the world and ab@@ using the international monetary system in order to sustain its military adv@@ ent@@ u@@ ris@@ m ( at that time in Vietnam ) .
indeed , US monetary expansion had itself become a weap@@ on in the war over exchange rates .
high inflation in the US high@@ ligh@@ ted the exchange @-@ rate problem by sho@@ wing the instability of the dollar standard .
indeed , Con@@ n@@ ally called the dollar &quot; our currency but your problem . &quot;
in the end , the US forced the Japanese to re@@ value their currency by destro@@ ying the international monetary order in August 197@@ 1 .
the Americans first unilater@@ ally sus@@ pen@@ ded the gold conver@@ ti@@ bility of the d@@ oll@@ ar@@ --@@ the back@@ b@@ one of the fi@@ xed but adju@@ stable exchange @-@ rate regime created by the post @-@ W@@ W@@ II B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods con@@ fer@@ en@@ ce@@ --@@ and then te@@ am@@ ed up with the Europeans to force on Japan a 16@@ .@@ 9 % re@@ val@@ uation of the Y@@ en against the dollar .
( Japan &apos;s Fin@@ ance Minister had threat@@ ened to com@@ mit har@@ a @-@ k@@ ir@@ i if the re@@ val@@ uation rate was set at 17 % . )
but the end of the fi@@ xed exchange @-@ rate regime for industrial countries did not end activi@@ st management of currencies .
the scenario of the early 1970 &apos;s was re@@ played with flo@@ ating rates in the mid @-@ 1980 &apos;s , with the me@@ et@@ ings of the major countries &apos; finance ministers first forcing down the Y@@ en and the D @-@ mark against the dollar , and then trying in 198@@ 7 to hold rates stable .
both of these historical ep@@ i@@ so@@ des ended in cha@@ os .
the break@@ down of B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods in 197@@ 1 , far from stopp@@ ing inflation , un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed a syn@@ chroni@@ zed monetary sur@@ ge .
a decade later , efforts to keep the Y@@ en in line with American views produced the Japanese bubble economy , for which many Japanese bl@@ am@@ ed America after it bur@@ st .
today , the US dollar is also looking at a challenge from two new or new@@ ly important currencies , China &apos;s ren@@ mi@@ m@@ bi and the Euro .
as in the 1970 &apos;s and the 1980 &apos;s , the rising Asian currency is seen as a much greater threat because that is where the biggest trade imbalances lie .
moreover , the US still has a powerful weap@@ on because other countries hold so many dollars : the current estim@@ ate is that 4@@ 6 % of US Treasury bonds are held over@@ se@@ as .
this inv@@ it@@ es both sides to play a game of br@@ in@@ k@@ man@@ ship .
America &apos;s leverage consi@@ sts in the rest of the world &apos;s massive financial stak@@ e in the f@@ ate of the dollar .
but the rest of the world can thre@@ aten a dollar sell @-@ off .
China &apos;s government today might find some us@@ eful lessons in the appar@@ ently remo@@ te dra@@ m@@ as of the 1970 &apos;s .
the most immediate and most obvious is that it is difficult to hold out long against the US , especially when the American government is under pressure from major domestic interest groups whose strong lob@@ b@@ ying power might be used to lead a push for new trade protection@@ ism .
but the world@@ --@@ and the US in particul@@ ar@@ --@@ might also learn some lessons .
previous ep@@ i@@ so@@ des in the politically driven creation of new exchange @-@ rate systems have been highly cha@@ o@@ tic , and resul@@ ted in increased levels of international ten@@ sion .
at an emo@@ tional level , deb@@ ating exchange rates means bl@@ am@@ ing for@@ eign@@ ers for whatever goes wrong in the domestic economy .
this approach is both un@@ healthy and im@@ mat@@ ure , yet not necessarily very dam@@ aging .
what is worse is when the economic policy response becomes the equivalent of bl@@ am@@ ing for@@ eign@@ ers : im@@ posing new forms of trade barriers .
doing so may feel good in the short term , but it merely destro@@ ys wealth and undermin@@ es job creation everywhere .
the D@@ om@@ esti@@ c Lo@@ gi@@ c of Iran &apos;s For@@ eign pl@@ ots
Washington , DC - Th@@ ough Saudi Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ or A@@ del al @-@ Ju@@ b@@ ei@@ r is ali@@ ve and well in Washington , the p@@ lot to ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ate him may have succ@@ ee@@ ded - if its aim was not to kil@@ l al @-@ Ju@@ b@@ ei@@ r , but rather Iranian President Mah@@ m@@ oud Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad &apos;s foreign policy .
the history of the Islamic Republic is fi@@ lled with cases of fac@@ tions explo@@ iting foreign policy to gain power against their domestic ri@@ v@@ als .
it is common for comp@@ eting groups to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce national interests - such as Iran &apos;s international credibility - to achieve their own goals .
during the Iran @-@ Iraq war , R@@ onald Reagan &apos;s national security ad@@ vis@@ er , Robert Mc@@ F@@ ar@@ lan@@ e , paid a c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine visit to Iran with the appro@@ val of the country &apos;s highest authorities , to pursue a deal that would have been to Iran &apos;s advantage .
but anti @-@ American el@@ ements in the government le@@ ak@@ ed the news to an Arab newspap@@ er , kil@@ ling the deal and land@@ ing both the Reagan administration and the Iranian government in huge trou@@ ble .
Mi@@ r Ho@@ s@@ s@@ ein M@@ ou@@ sav@@ i , the former prime minister who now leads the opposition , sp@@ ell@@ ed out the problem more than 20 years ago .
on September 5 , 198@@ 8 , he re@@ signed in prot@@ est against then @-@ president Al@@ i K@@ ham@@ enei &apos;s inter@@ ference in his du@@ ties .
in his re@@ sig@@ nation let@@ ter , M@@ ou@@ sav@@ i comp@@ la@@ ined that the &quot; government &apos;s authority on foreign policy was taken away . &quot;
he char@@ ged that
&quot; &#91; military and intelligence &#93; operations outside the country are taking place without the government &apos;s knowledge or or@@ ders .@@ ... O@@ n@@ ly after an air@@ plan@@ e is hi@@ j@@ acked are we made aw@@ are of it .
only after a mach@@ ine gun op@@ ens fire in one of Lebanon &apos;s stre@@ ets and its no@@ ise ech@@ o@@ es everywhere do we find out .
only after &#91; Saudi police &#93; find explo@@ sive material in Iranian p@@ il@@ gri@@ ms &quot; bag@@ g@@ age am I in@@ formed . &quot;
Iranian intelligence has ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ated more than 4@@ 00 Iranian dis@@ sidents outside of Iran , including the last prime minister under the S@@ ha@@ h , S@@ ha@@ po@@ ur B@@ ak@@ h@@ ti@@ ar , and four Kur@@ ds in Berlin &apos;s Mi@@ kon@@ os rest@@ au@@ r@@ ant in 1992 ( a German ju@@ dge later offici@@ ally nam@@ ed Iran &apos;s Su@@ pre@@ me Le@@ ader as one of the senior officials involved in the terrorist attack ) .
similarly , the Qu@@ ds For@@ ce of Iran &apos;s Re@@ volution@@ ary Gu@@ ard has car@@ ried out hundreds of operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon , and elsewhere .
by contrast , the p@@ lot targe@@ ting al @-@ Ju@@ b@@ ei@@ r seems to have been highly un@@ profession@@ al , almost un@@ concerned with success .
so unlikely are the deta@@ ils that only a power struggle within Iran could justi@@ fy it .
if so , the p@@ lot &apos;s target likely was not al @-@ Ju@@ b@@ ei@@ r himself , but rather those el@@ ements in the regime that seek a diplomatic opening to the US - &amp; # 160 ; nam@@ ely , Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad and his cir@@ cle .
when news about the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation p@@ lot first appeared , the Su@@ pre@@ me Le@@ ader , Al@@ i K@@ ham@@ enei , was on his way to the west@@ ern provin@@ ce of K@@ er@@ man@@ sha@@ h .
in his first speech after the story bro@@ ke , he made no refer@@ ence to it , most likely expec@@ ting the president to make a stat@@ ement .
after two days of Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad &apos;s mean@@ ing@@ ful sil@@ ence , K@@ ham@@ enei felt forced to re@@ ject the US al@@ leg@@ ations public@@ ly .
only after five days did Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad issue a stat@@ ement den@@ ying the acc@@ us@@ ations - and not as strong@@ ly as did K@@ ham@@ enei .
it is ir@@ oni@@ c to see Iran &apos;s radical Islamist president por@@ tra@@ y himself as open to resu@@ ming US @-@ Iran relations and suffer for it at the hands of a sup@@ pos@@ edly pragmati@@ c Su@@ pre@@ me Le@@ ader .
but Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad is no exc@@ eption to the historical rule in Iran : every fac@@ tion that los@@ es out to its domestic ri@@ v@@ als looks beyond the country for an alliance with outside powers .
in the Islamic Republic , those interest@@ ed in opening up to the West are typically those with little authority .
Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad and his fac@@ tion face a two @-@ ed@@ ged problem : K@@ ham@@ enei has bo@@ xed them in politically , while ra@@ mp@@ ant economic corruption and failed efforts at reform have di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ed many of the president &apos;s supporters .
as a result , Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad , in a further ir@@ oni@@ c twi@@ st , is seeking to gl@@ ori@@ fy Iran &apos;s pre @-@ Islamic history in order to sti@@ r nationalist senti@@ ment in his favor and ac@@ compli@@ sh what he is sure that K@@ ham@@ enei does not want : greater open@@ ness to the West , particularly to the US .
he has repe@@ ate@@ dly ex@@ pressed his willingness to meet with US President Barack Obama - even sen@@ ding him a con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ atory let@@ ter on his in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration - and has tra@@ vel@@ ed to New York to be inter@@ viewed by the American media much more often than his pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors .
Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad is well aw@@ are that if he succ@@ ee@@ ds in por@@ tra@@ ying himself as some@@ one who - in opposition to the Su@@ pre@@ me Le@@ ader &apos;s will - wants to solve major issues between Iran and the US , that could partly compens@@ ate for his economic fail@@ ures and gain him some new supporters .
for that plan to work , Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad needs to survi@@ ve through the next parliamentary election in March 2012 and the presidential election in June 2013 , despite K@@ ham@@ enei &apos;s determin@@ ation to margin@@ alize him .
regardless of whether K@@ ham@@ enei was aw@@ are of the p@@ lot against al @-@ Ju@@ b@@ ei@@ r , its pur@@ pose was to del@@ e@@ gi@@ timi@@ ze Ahmadine@@ j@@ ad &apos;s foreign @-@ policy agenda .
so , if K@@ ham@@ enei really was un@@ aw@@ are of the p@@ lot , it means that some el@@ ements in the government or the Re@@ volution@@ ary Gu@@ ards are ac@@ ting on their own , which is deeply tro@@ ub@@ ling in its own right .
if there are el@@ ements powerful enough to plan such a p@@ lot - &amp; # 160 ; even an un@@ successful one - they could do it again in the future .
that rais@@ es an even more tro@@ ub@@ ling question : if such &quot; independent &quot; decision @-@ makers exist , are they able to aff@@ ect Iran &apos;s nuclear policy , too ? &amp; # 160 ;
the D@@ om@@ esti@@ c W@@ ars of Ho@@ s@@ ni Mubarak
the decision by Egyp@@ tian President Ho@@ s@@ ni Mubarak &apos;s government to try two senior jud@@ ges for b@@ low@@ ing the whi@@ st@@ le on vote ri@@ gg@@ ing in last au@@ tum@@ n &apos;s parliamentary elections has ro@@ ck@@ ed the country .
massive crow@@ ds have ga@@ ther@@ ed to support the jud@@ ges - and have cau@@ ght Mubarak &apos;s regime comple@@ t@@ ely un@@ aw@@ are .
Mubarak &apos;s government now seems to be back@@ tra@@ cking as fast as it can .
ju@@ dge Mah@@ m@@ oud M@@ ek@@ ki has been acqu@@ it@@ ted , and Ju@@ dge H@@ is@@ ha@@ m al @-@ Ba@@ sta@@ wis@@ y , who suffer@@ ed a heart attack the ni@@ ght before , has merely been re@@ prim@@ anded .
yet C@@ air@@ o remains rest@@ less , and the government fears another out@@ po@@ uring of support for democracy , as the jud@@ ges have called for rene@@ wed nation@@ wide demon@@ stra@@ tions .
Egyp@@ tian jud@@ ges have a long @-@ standing tradi@@ tion of dis@@ cre@@ tion and pro@@ pri@@ ety .
but they feel ab@@ used by government efforts to su@@ gar@@ co@@ at the manipul@@ ation of election after election by claim@@ ing that jud@@ ges super@@ vi@@ se the vot@@ ing .
what makes their struggle loo@@ m so large for a norm@@ ally qui@@ es@@ cent Egyp@@ tian public is partly that nearly all 9@@ ,000 jud@@ ges are standing fast in solidarity .
their represent@@ ative body , the Ju@@ d@@ ges &quot; C@@ lu@@ b , has long push@@ ed for a new law to restore judi@@ cial independence .
now the jud@@ ges are in@@ sist@@ ing on their independence by themselves .
the Mubarak regime is ad@@ am@@ antly op@@ posed , and res@@ or@@ ts to ex@@ tra @-@ judi@@ cial means , such as emer@@ gency cour@@ ts and national security and military cour@@ ts , which do not ob@@ serve international standards .
contrary to his campaign promises during his run for a fif@@ th term as President , Mubarak has requ@@ est@@ ed ( and his ru@@ b@@ ber @-@ st@@ amp parliament has gran@@ ted ) a two @-@ year exten@@ sion of the E@@ mer@@ gency La@@ w by which Egypt has been ru@@ led throughout his presidency .
it is to this law , above all , that the jud@@ ges and Egypt &apos;s civil society ob@@ ject .
the E@@ mer@@ gency La@@ w has been in force since the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of President An@@ war Sad@@ at in October 198@@ 1 , and Mubarak claims that he needs another exten@@ sion to com@@ bat terrorism .
but , according to a recent human rights report , despite the E@@ mer@@ gency La@@ w , 8@@ 9 people were killed and 2@@ 3@@ 6 wo@@ und@@ ed in terrorist attacks in Egypt during the previous 12 months .
in neighbor@@ ing Israel , which is still in a struggle with the Palestinians , only 18 were killed and 25 wo@@ und@@ ed in similar attacks during the same period .
yet Israelis do not live under an emer@@ gency law .
consider , moreover , that at the hei@@ ght of the Arab @-@ Israeli conflict in 197@@ 3 , Egypt &apos;s armed forces stood at one million troops .
now only 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 serve in the military , while the internal security police recently hit the one @-@ million mark .
Mubarak &apos;s first internal war was with Islamic milit@@ ants during his early years in power , but he now fin@@ ds himself cau@@ ght in three more domestic wars .
the battle with the jud@@ ges has inc@@ ited enough popular un@@ rest to war@@ r@@ ant Mubarak &apos;s dep@@ loy@@ ment of thousands of bl@@ ack @-@ uni@@ formed central security forces in the heart of C@@ air@@ o .
this dep@@ loy@@ ment , la@@ sting three weeks so far , is already longer than the combined du@@ ration of the last two wars with Israel .
another domestic war , with the Egyp@@ tian Be@@ dou@@ ins of Sin@@ ai , bro@@ ke out two years ago .
taking their c@@ ue from their Palestinian neighbors , if not from al @-@ Qaeda , alien@@ ated young Be@@ dou@@ ins appar@@ ently decided to re@@ bel against their treatment as third @-@ class citizens .
all around them , but especially in the e@@ bul@@ li@@ ent res@@ or@@ ts of southern Sin@@ ai , billions are spent on ro@@ ads , air@@ ports , and be@@ aches ; si@@ ze@@ able par@@ c@@ els of land are alloc@@ ated gener@@ ously to rich Egyp@@ ti@@ ans from the Ni@@ le V@@ alle@@ y and to for@@ eign@@ ers , but not to Sin@@ ai n@@ atives .
indeed , Sin@@ ai Be@@ dou@@ ins have the right of use but not ow@@ ner@@ ship of land , because a le@@ th@@ ar@@ gi@@ c , occ@@ asion@@ ally cor@@ rupt bureau@@ cracy still de@@ ems the Sin@@ ai a military zone and its n@@ atives &quot; loy@@ al@@ ty ques@@ tion@@ able .
two years ago , on the anni@@ vers@@ ary of the war of October 197@@ 3 , young Sin@@ ai milit@@ ants bom@@ bed the T@@ ab@@ a Hil@@ ton .
last July , on another national ho@@ li@@ day , they hit three tou@@ ri@@ st spo@@ ts not far from the Mubarak family com@@ po@@ und in Shar@@ m el @-@ S@@ hei@@ k@@ h .
these symboli@@ c as well as le@@ th@@ al war@@ nings to a family that has grown P@@ har@@ a@@ oni@@ c in scale , style , and power have gone un@@ he@@ e@@ ded .
the third recent domestic war , this one over Christi@@ an C@@ op@@ tic citi@@ zen@@ ship rights , has been bre@@ wing for years .
C@@ op@@ ts are the origin@@ al Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and they were the majority population until the tent@@ h century .
as Egypt was Arabi@@ zed and Islami@@ zed , the C@@ op@@ ts became a minority in their origin@@ al hom@@ el@@ and .
in Mubarak &apos;s Egypt , citizens &quot; legal equ@@ ality , while sti@@ pul@@ ated in the constitution , is not resp@@ ected or obser@@ ved , especially with regard to the construction and protection of C@@ op@@ tic ch@@ ur@@ ches .
last November , when Muslim ze@@ al@@ ots att@@ acked a C@@ op@@ tic ch@@ ur@@ ch in Ale@@ x@@ and@@ ri@@ a , several C@@ op@@ ts were in@@ ju@@ red .
six months later , a fan@@ ati@@ c targe@@ ted three ch@@ ur@@ ches during Sun@@ day services , kil@@ ling a few wor@@ shi@@ p@@ per@@ s and in@@ j@@ uring many .
C@@ op@@ ts mar@@ ched in the stre@@ ets of Ale@@ x@@ and@@ ri@@ a for the next three days , prote@@ sting the security authorities &quot; len@@ i@@ ency toward the cul@@ pri@@ ts , the sc@@ ap@@ e@@ go@@ ating of their community , or even an official hand in the attacks to justi@@ fy an exten@@ sion of the E@@ mer@@ gency La@@ w .
Ho@@ s@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak@@ s &quot; four domestic wars are fu@@ ell@@ ed by Egypt &apos;s exclu@@ ded , who are increasingly in re@@ bel@@ li@@ on against a regime that has long out@@ li@@ ved its legitimate mandate .
the battle with the jud@@ ges may well prove to be Mubarak &apos;s A@@ chil@@ les &quot; he@@ el .
justice is a central value for Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , and its absence is at the core of all protests .
there can be no evidence more comp@@ elling than the unprecedented numbers of people who have r@@ al@@ lied peac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in solidarity with the jud@@ ges .
America &apos;s Lab@@ or Mark@@ et by the N@@ um@@ bers
Ne@@ w@@ port B@@ EA@@ C@@ H - Politi@@ ci@@ ans and economists now join investors in a ri@@ tual that typically takes place on the first F@@ ri@@ day of each month and has important consequences for global markets : anti@@ cip@@ ating , intern@@ ali@@ zing , and re@@ ac@@ ting to the mon@@ th@@ ly employment report rele@@ ased by the United States Bu@@ re@@ au of Lab@@ or St@@ atisti@@ cs ( B@@ L@@ S ) .
over the last few years , the report has e@@ vol@@ ved in a significant way - not only providing an assess@@ ment of the economy &apos;s past and current state , but , increasingly , con@@ taining insi@@ ghts into its future as well .
think of the B@@ L@@ S &apos;s employment report as a comprehensive mon@@ th@@ ly ch@@ eck @-@ up for the American labor market .
among its many interest@@ ing statisti@@ cs , it t@@ ells you how many jobs are created and where ; how ear@@ nings and hours worked are e@@ vol@@ ving ; and the number , age , and education of those seeking employment .
despite the data &apos;s rich@@ ness , only two indic@@ ators consist@@ ently attrac@@ t widespread attention : net mon@@ th@@ ly job creation ( which amoun@@ ted to 16@@ 9@@ ,000 in August ) and the unemployment rate ( 7@@ .@@ 3 % in August , the low@@ est since December 2008 ) .
together they point to a gradu@@ al and ste@@ ad@@ y impro@@ vement in overall labor @-@ market conditions .
this is certainly good news .
it is not long ago that job creation was negative and the unemployment rate stood at 10 % .
the problem is that the head@@ line numbers shed only parti@@ al light on what may lie ahead .
the fig@@ ure for mon@@ th@@ ly job creation , for example , is dist@@ or@@ ted by the growing importance of part @-@ time employment , and it fail@@ s to conv@@ ey the reality of stag@@ n@@ ant ear@@ nings .
meanwhile , the head@@ line unemployment rate does not reflect the growing number of Americans who have left the work force - a phen@@ om@@ en@@ on vi@@ vi@@ dly reflected by the decline in the labor participation rate to just 6@@ 3.@@ 2 % , a 35 @-@ year low .
to get a real sense of the labor market &apos;s health , we need to look elsewhere in the B@@ L@@ S &apos;s report .
what these other numbers have to tell us - about both the present and the future - is far from re@@ ass@@ uring .
consider the statisti@@ cs on the du@@ ration of unemployment .
after all , the longer one is un@@ employ@@ ed , the har@@ der it is to find a full @-@ time job at a dec@@ ent wage .
in August , the B@@ L@@ S classi@@ fied 4.@@ 3 million Americans as long @-@ term un@@ employ@@ ed , or 3@@ 7@@ .@@ 9 % of the total un@@ employ@@ ed - a wor@@ ri@@ some fig@@ ure , given that the global financial crisis was five years ago .
and , re@@ member , this number exclu@@ des all the dis@@ coura@@ ged Americans who are no longer looking for a job .
in fact , the more comprehensive employment / population ratio stands at only 5@@ 8@@ .@@ 6 % .
the te@@ en@@ age @-@ unemployment rate is another under @-@ appreci@@ ated indic@@ ator that is at an al@@ arm@@ ing level .
at 2@@ 2.@@ 7 % , too many American te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers , lac@@ king ste@@ ad@@ y work experience early in their profession@@ al care@@ ers , risk going from un@@ employ@@ ed to un@@ employ@@ able .
then there are the indic@@ ators that lin@@ k educ@@ ational at@@ tain@@ ment and employment status . most not@@ able here is the growing gap between those with a colle@@ ge degree ( where the unemployment rate is only 3.@@ 5 % ) and those lac@@ king a high school diplom@@ a ( 1@@ 1.@@ 3 % ) .
rather than con@@ fir@@ ming the par@@ a@@ dig@@ m of gradu@@ al and ste@@ ad@@ y impro@@ vement , these dis@@ aggre@@ g@@ ated numbers att@@ est to a highly se@@ g@@ ment@@ ed , multi @-@ spe@@ ed labor market - one with feat@@ ures that could become more deeply em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the structure of the economy .
if current trends per@@ sist , the B@@ L@@ S &apos;s report will continue to e@@ vol@@ ve from a s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of the past and present to a pre@@ view of the future .
und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly , the US labor market &apos;s un@@ even recovery has much to do with the structural and policy g@@ aps ex@@ posed by the 2008 global financial crisis and the recession that followed .
the economy is still strugg@@ ling to provide a sufficient number of jobs for those who were pre@@ viously employ@@ ed in leverage @-@ driven activities that are no longer sustainable ( let alone desi@@ rable ) .
moreover , US schools , particularly at the primary and sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y levels , continue to s@@ li@@ p down the global scale , constra@@ ining Americans &quot; ability to benefit from globalization .
meanwhile , existing and new@@ ly created jobs provide less of an ear@@ nings up@@ side .
and political pol@@ ari@@ zation nar@@ ro@@ ws the sco@@ pe for effective tac@@ ti@@ cal and structural policy respon@@ ses .
this combination of factors is particularly bur@@ den@@ some for the most vulnerable se@@ g@@ ments of the US population - particularly those with limited educ@@ ational at@@ tain@@ ment , first @-@ time labor @-@ market entr@@ ants , and those who have been out of work for an exten@@ ded period .
so while net job creation will continue and the unemployment rate will maintain its down@@ ward tra@@ jec@@ tory - both highly wel@@ come - the labor market &apos;s e@@ volution risks fu@@ eling rather than counter@@ ing already @-@ significant income and wealth ine@@ quali@@ ties , as well as poverty .
over@@ bur@@ den@@ ed social support mechanisms would thus come under even greater pressure .
and all of this would amp@@ li@@ fy rather than atten@@ u@@ ate political pol@@ ari@@ zation , plac@@ ing other urg@@ ent policy pri@@ orities at even greater risk .
if this interpre@@ tation is correc@@ t , the hei@@ ghten@@ ed attention given to the mon@@ th@@ ly B@@ L@@ S head@@ line indic@@ ators needs to be ac@@ compani@@ ed by a broader analysis and a different min@@ d@@ set .
after all , the report is much more than a sco@@ rec@@ ard on America &apos;s performance in confron@@ ting a per@@ sist@@ ent economic , political , and social challenge ; it is also an urg@@ ent call for a more focused correc@@ tive effort invol@@ ving both government and business .
a better mi@@ x of fiscal and monetary policies and sustained measures to enh@@ ance productivity and competitiveness remain necessary conditions for addressing America &apos;s labor @-@ market challenges .
but they are not sufficient .
both the public and private sectors - individu@@ ally and through sc@@ al@@ able and du@@ rable partner@@ ships - need to think much more seriously about labor re@@ training and re@@ to@@ ol@@ ing programs , enh@@ anced labor mo@@ bility , voc@@ ational training , and intern@@ ships .
President Barack Obama &apos;s appoin@@ tment of a &quot; jobs c@@ z@@ ar &quot; would also help to enh@@ ance the credibility , accoun@@ tability , and coordin@@ ation required to overcome today &apos;s significant and rising employment challenges .
yes , the head@@ line numbers will continue to sign@@ al overall impro@@ vement in the labor market .
the urg@@ ent task now is to ensure that la@@ sting progress is not undermin@@ ed by the wor@@ ri@@ some com@@ posi@@ tional trends that the B@@ L@@ S &apos;s report high@@ li@@ ghts month after month .
the Dra@@ g@@ on and the Be@@ ar
second hon@@ e@@ y@@ mo@@ ons ra@@ rely , if ever , rec@@ ap@@ ture the z@@ est of lost lo@@ ve .
yet ever since the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 , Russia and China have sought to re@@ kin@@ d@@ le the close relations that once sup@@ pos@@ edly exist@@ ed between the US@@ S@@ R and Mao &apos;s China before K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v &apos;s den@@ un@@ ci@@ ation of Sta@@ lin in 195@@ 6 .
but that rene@@ wed Sin@@ o @-@ Russian mar@@ ri@@ age always sm@@ acked more of conven@@ i@@ ence - aimed as it was at ch@@ ec@@ king American he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y - than of true ro@@ man@@ ce .
now Russia &apos;s inv@@ asion of Georgia has sh@@ at@@ tered even the illu@@ sion of attrac@@ tion .
in 196@@ 9 , the Chinese and Soviet ar@@ mi@@ es ex@@ changed fire across their disp@@ ut@@ ed border .
recently , the two countries signed an agreement that seemed to put an end to their long border disp@@ ute .
the agreement was a s@@ ort of follow @-@ up to the visit to Beijing of D@@ mi@@ try Med@@ ve@@ de@@ v , who made China one of his first official tri@@ ps abroad after being elected Russia &apos;s president .
during Vladimir Putin &apos;s presidency , Chinese and Russian troops eng@@ aged in jo@@ int military man@@ eu@@ vers , and the two countries became domin@@ ant powers in the Sh@@ ang@@ ha@@ i Co@@ operation Organization ( S@@ C@@ O ) , which , to some Western obser@@ vers , loo@@ ked like an effort to counter@@ balance NATO .
there were also years of &quot; Russia in China &quot; and &quot; China in Russia &quot; cultural ex@@ changes , meant to under@@ s@@ core that the two countries were ti@@ ed together not just by geopolitical pragmati@@ sm , but by genuine cultural / historical ties as well .
but the fact is that 17 years of high @-@ level bilateral cooperation have produced little of subst@@ ance .
indeed , in the w@@ ake of the inv@@ asion of Georgia , China may be seriously re@@ thinking its relations with Russia .
it may not yet be ready to em@@ bar@@ k on a full @-@ fle@@ dged policy of &quot; con@@ tain@@ ment , &quot; but in the w@@ ake of the dis@@ member@@ ment of Georgia - and with Russia claim@@ ing a zone of &quot; pri@@ vi@@ leg@@ ed influence &quot; throughout the former Soviet world - China clearly views Russia as an emerging strategic threat .
for example , China has ref@@ used to end@@ or@@ se Russia &apos;s recognition of the independence of South O@@ s@@ se@@ ti@@ a and Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ a , and has encoura@@ ged the S@@ C@@ O &apos;s other members to do the same .
the reasons are not hard to find .
as a general principle of foreign policy , China belie@@ ves that national borders are s@@ acro@@ sanc@@ t .
no power , not even the United Nations , should be allowed to change them without the con@@ sent of the country concerned .
more import@@ antly , China views the break @-@ up of the US@@ S@@ R as one of the greatest strategic gi@@ f@@ ts in its history .
instead of confron@@ ting a ( usually hosti@@ le ) Russian / Soviet emp@@ ire on its border , a vast s@@ w@@ ath of bu@@ ffer states appeared after 1991 .
their continued independence is now de@@ em@@ ed essential to China &apos;s national security .
as a result , any more Russian efforts to establish even in@@ formal su@@ zer@@ a@@ in@@ ty over the Soviet success@@ or states are , following the dis@@ member@@ ment of Georgia , likely to meet Chinese resistance .
the economic comp@@ onents of the Sin@@ o @-@ Russian relationship - where real att@@ ach@@ ments are te@@ sted - are also dis@@ satis@@ fac@@ tory , at least from China &apos;s point of view .
China &apos;s major interest in Russia is oil and gas .
but , while Russia is fir@@ m@@ ly committed to being a major supp@@ lier of gas and oil to Europe , it is he@@ si@@ t@@ ant to play a similar role with China .
moreover , Russia &apos;s efforts to gain mon@@ opo@@ ly control of the gas pi@@ pel@@ ine networks across E@@ u@@ ra@@ sia pose a direct danger for China , because mon@@ o@@ poli@@ sts can not only g@@ ou@@ ge their consumers , but also sh@@ ut off supp@@ lies for political pur@@ poses , as Russia has done repe@@ ate@@ dly over the past two decades .
so China &apos;s national security interest is to ensure that the gas @-@ sup@@ pl@@ ying nations of Central Asia have out@@ le@@ ts to sell their gas that are not under Kremlin control .
other than oil , gas , and other commodi@@ ties , China has rather limited interests in Russia .
Russia has been China &apos;s major supp@@ lier of weapons since the late 1990 &quot; s .
but , given the stag@@ n@@ ant state of Russian science and technology , even the best Russian equi@@ p@@ ment nowadays seems out of d@@ ate .
indeed , although the war with Georgia demonstrated the revi@@ ved com@@ bat spiri@@ t of the Russian army - at least when compared to its in@@ ep@@ tn@@ ess in the two Che@@ chen wars of the 1990 &quot; s - it also ex@@ hi@@ b@@ ited the gra@@ ve def@@ ects of Russian military technology .
most of the arms used were y@@ est@@ er@@ day &apos;s weapons .
as China is now able to har@@ ness its own technological might to produce s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated weapons , Russia &apos;s us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness in this area is wan@@ ing fast .
nor do the Chinese have much interest in assum@@ ing de facto control of Asi@@ ati@@ c Russia , despite sh@@ rie@@ ks from Russian strategic pun@@ di@@ ts that this is China &apos;s real goal .
China might , indeed , have an interest in some border areas with fer@@ ti@@ le so@@ il and moderate climate .
but it hardly wi@@ sh@@ es to coloni@@ ze the f@@ ro@@ zen wa@@ stes of Si@@ ber@@ ia .
in fact , Si@@ ber@@ ia is not much different from China &apos;s own almost emp@@ ty moun@@ tain / des@@ ert bor@@ der@@ lands , where even agri@@ culture is a da@@ un@@ ting task .
as for Russia &apos;s F@@ ar East , the Chinese believe it will eventually fall to China any@@ way , so there is no need to ha@@ sten the process .
China is far more interest@@ ed in foc@@ using on the United States , its major trade partner and ri@@ val , and on South Asia and Iran , which supp@@ lies much of China &apos;s oil and regar@@ ds it as a more reli@@ able ally than Russia .
thus , the sett@@ ling of the border disp@@ ute with Russia was not aimed so much at building a geopolitical mar@@ ri@@ age as sec@@ uring each other &apos;s re@@ ar , off@@ ering both sides a free hand to ex@@ pl@@ ore opportunities elsewhere .
what China wants and what it gets may be different things .
with its long borders with Russia , China knows it would have much to re@@ gre@@ t if a new , oil @-@ fi@@ red Russian emp@@ ire appeared on its do@@ or@@ step .
the D@@ re@@ am of Sp@@ ace
more than 50 years ago , vi@@ sion@@ aries like the British science fic@@ tion wri@@ ter Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ . C@@ l@@ ark@@ e and the German ( and American ) ro@@ ck@@ et engine@@ er W@@ ern@@ her von Br@@ au@@ n la@@ id out a seri@@ es of steps for the jour@@ ney into space .
C@@ lar@@ k pres@@ ented his vision in a 195@@ 1 book The Ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation of Sp@@ ace and von Br@@ au@@ n &apos;s proposals appeared in a seri@@ es of Col@@ lier &apos;s ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine arti@@ cles publi@@ shed between 195@@ 2 and 195@@ 4 .
a few years later - indeed , 50 years ago this week - the Soviet Union launched the first ear@@ th or@@ bit@@ ing sat@@ el@@ li@@ te , in@@ au@@ g@@ ur@@ ating the space age .
after 50 years , many el@@ ements of the origin@@ al vision have been achieved , some have failed , and there have been more than a few surpri@@ ses .
C@@ l@@ ark@@ e and von Br@@ au@@ n en@@ counter@@ ed a w@@ all of skepti@@ cism when their proposals first appeared .
the public viewed space tra@@ v@@ el as science fic@@ tion , a form of popular enter@@ tain@@ ment thought to have little chance of re@@ alization .
but C@@ l@@ ark@@ e , von Br@@ au@@ n , and others per@@ sever@@ ed .
we would , they predic@@ ted , laun@@ ch sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es , disp@@ at@@ ch hum@@ ans on or@@ bit@@ al f@@ li@@ ghts , ass@@ em@@ ble a large ear@@ th @-@ or@@ bit@@ ing space st@@ ation , build re@@ us@@ able space sh@@ ut@@ t@@ les , con@@ struc@@ t space tel@@ es@@ co@@ p@@ es , and sen@@ d hum@@ ans to the mo@@ on , V@@ en@@ us , and M@@ ars .
C@@ l@@ ark@@ e expla@@ ined how hum@@ ans could build communic@@ ation sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es .
von Br@@ au@@ n predic@@ ted that military forces would use or@@ bit@@ ing plat@@ forms to ob@@ serve tro@@ op movements and prevent surprise attacks .
all of these vi@@ sions appeared before the first arti@@ fi@@ cial sat@@ el@@ li@@ te was launched .
in 195@@ 9 , officials at the United States National A@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics and Sp@@ ace Administration ( NA@@ S@@ A ) adopted most of these steps as part of their long @-@ range plan .
the Soviet Union eng@@ aged the US in a ra@@ ce to the mo@@ on .
government support for reali@@ zing the vision in@@ spi@@ red the British fil@@ m ma@@ ker St@@ an@@ le@@ y Ku@@ bri@@ ck to present the steps in his classi@@ c mo@@ vi@@ e 2001 : a Sp@@ ace O@@ d@@ ys@@ se@@ y , rele@@ ased in 196@@ 8 .
C@@ l@@ ark@@ e helped to wri@@ te the s@@ cre@@ en@@ play .
the mo@@ vi@@ e de@@ pi@@ c@@ ted a large space st@@ ation , a w@@ ing@@ ed space sh@@ ut@@ tle , a l@@ un@@ ar base , and a@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ ts on a tri@@ p to the ou@@ ter sol@@ ar system .
true to the plan , hum@@ ans built scientific sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es , communic@@ ation sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es , recon@@ n@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance or &quot; sp@@ y &quot; sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es , space st@@ ations , and re@@ us@@ able space sh@@ ut@@ t@@ les .
they sent ro@@ bo@@ tic sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to the mo@@ on , V@@ en@@ us , M@@ ars , and other plan@@ ets , and hum@@ ans to the mo@@ on .
in those resp@@ ects , the origin@@ al vision was achieved .
the human space effort , nonetheless , de@@ par@@ ted from the plan in un@@ expected ways .
the International Sp@@ ace St@@ ation , currently under construction , does not res@@ em@@ ble the large , rot@@ ating whe@@ els pres@@ ented by Ku@@ bri@@ ck , C@@ l@@ ark@@ e , and von Br@@ au@@ n .
early plann@@ ers viewed the space st@@ ation as an ass@@ em@@ bly point for ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions to the mo@@ on and plan@@ ets .
Ku@@ bri@@ ck &apos;s 9@@ 00 @-@ fo@@ ot wide whe@@ el rot@@ ated in such a fas@@ hi@@ on as to produce a sense of gra@@ v@@ ity equal to that felt on the mo@@ on , to which many of the st@@ ation &apos;s fic@@ tional occup@@ ants were bound .
the real space st@@ ation is a mi@@ cr@@ o @-@ gra@@ v@@ ity research lab@@ or@@ atory with no cap@@ ability to laun@@ ch tri@@ ps to the mo@@ on or beyond .
larger cap@@ abilities were part of the origin@@ al space st@@ ation plan , appro@@ ved in 198@@ 4 , but sub@@ sequ@@ ently dis@@ appeared as the cost of the faci@@ lity gre@@ w .
nor has the US space sh@@ ut@@ tle ac@@ compli@@ shed its goals .
von Br@@ au@@ n predic@@ ted that the US would need to laun@@ ch 3@@ 6@@ 4 space sh@@ ut@@ t@@ les in less than one year to pre@@ p@@ are for the first l@@ un@@ ar vo@@ y@@ age .
when the space sh@@ ut@@ tle was appro@@ ved in 197@@ 2 , NA@@ S@@ A officials predic@@ ted that they would laun@@ ch one every week or two .
but the space sh@@ ut@@ tle has pro@@ ven far more difficult and costly to operate than anti@@ cip@@ ated , fl@@ ying only four times per year on average .
it has neither reduced the cost of space access nor made space f@@ light safe and ro@@ ut@@ ine , as promised .
when the sh@@ ut@@ tle is reti@@ red around 2010 , NA@@ S@@ A will re@@ place it with an old @-@ fas@@ hi@@ oned sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft with no w@@ ings at all .
in contrast to human space f@@ light , which has la@@ gg@@ ed behind expectations , the ro@@ bo@@ tic space effort has exc@@ ee@@ ded them .
von Br@@ au@@ n end@@ or@@ sed an autom@@ ated tel@@ es@@ co@@ pe in space , but thought that a@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ ts would need to visit the instru@@ ment to change the fil@@ m .
early plans for military recon@@ n@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance st@@ ations assum@@ ed that soldi@@ ers would be st@@ ation@@ ed on board .
C@@ l@@ ark@@ e believed that a@@ str@@ on@@ au@@ ts would be disp@@ at@@ ched to maintain and operate communic@@ ation sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es .
Ku@@ bri@@ ck suggest@@ ed that people - ac@@ compani@@ ed by a compu@@ ter - would pi@@ lot sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft to ex@@ pl@@ ore plan@@ ets like J@@ up@@ it@@ er and S@@ at@@ ur@@ n .
but none of this proved necessary , owing to remark@@ able adv@@ ances in ro@@ bo@@ tics , soli@@ d @-@ state elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ cs , ima@@ ging , data collec@@ tion , and communic@@ ation .
sen@@ s@@ ors that conver@@ t light wa@@ ves into elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c sign@@ als elimin@@ ated the need for fil@@ m on space tel@@ es@@ co@@ p@@ es , while compu@@ ter ch@@ i@@ p technology ( integr@@ ated cir@@ cu@@ its ) allowed communic@@ ation sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es to be oper@@ ated without peri@@ o@@ di@@ c human re@@ pa@@ ir .
ro@@ bo@@ tic sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft are currently re@@ turning information from the ou@@ ter regions of the sol@@ ar system and ro@@ ving the sur@@ face of M@@ ars .
no military force has yet perceived the need to st@@ ation soldi@@ ers on its various recon@@ n@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , communic@@ ation , or n@@ avi@@ g@@ ation sat@@ el@@ lit@@ es .
ro@@ bo@@ tic technology is adv@@ ancing more rapidly than the technologies supporting human space f@@ light .
around the world , cle@@ ver scientists , engine@@ ers , and entrep@@ rene@@ urs are working to reali@@ ze the rema@@ in@@ der of the space ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation dre@@ am . wat@@ ch for hum@@ ans to establish space tou@@ ris@@ m , return to the mo@@ on , and attempt an ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion to M@@ ars .
adv@@ ances in ro@@ bo@@ tics will continue to occur , with autom@@ ated sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft that can dig and s@@ wi@@ m , and tel@@ es@@ co@@ p@@ es that can look for ear@@ th @-@ like plan@@ ets around ne@@ ar@@ by st@@ ars .
if the past is any gui@@ de , much of what seems like science fic@@ tion today will become reality tom@@ or@@ row .
the Dru@@ g War \ u@@ 0@@ 0@@ 27@@ s F@@ ail@@ ures
if we &apos;@@ re lu@@ ck@@ y , our gr@@ and@@ children will rec@@ all the global war on drugs of the late 20@@ th and early 2@@ 1@@ st century as some bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re mani@@ a to which only past gener@@ ations could succ@@ um@@ b .
the world &apos;s drug problems are far more severe today than they were a century ago .
not that drug use has increased f@@ ant@@ as@@ ti@@ cally - after all , huge quanti@@ ties of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , op@@ i@@ um and other drugs were consum@@ ed back then .
the real problem is that today &apos;s drug control policies fo@@ ster more har@@ m than good ; indeed , they probably cause more overall har@@ m than drug ab@@ use itself .
like al@@ co@@ ho@@ l Pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion in the US during the 19@@ 20@@ s and early 193@@ 0s , global drug pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion has failed to reduce drug ab@@ use even as it gener@@ ates extra@@ ordinary levels of crime , violence , corruption and disease .
in 1998 , the UN estimated the total value of the illi@@ cit drug trade at $ 4@@ 00 billion , or 7 % of global trade .
critics say the fig@@ ure is only half that - still a remark@@ able su@@ m .
Col@@ om@@ bia today is far worse than Chi@@ c@@ ago under Al C@@ ap@@ one . so , too , are other Latin American , C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an and Asian countries .
drug pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion effectively im@@ poses a tax on the global trade in illi@@ cit drugs that is en@@ forced by governments and collec@@ ted by those willing to viol@@ ate the laws .
no other set of laws produ@@ ces so much revenue for crimin@@ als , terrorists and cor@@ rupt officials .
no other laws generate so much corruption or such violence ; and no other set of laws contribu@@ tes so much to the spread of HIV / AIDS , he@@ pati@@ ti@@ s and other diseases .
the war on drugs per@@ si@@ sts in part because of two my@@ ths .
the first assum@@ es that human bein@@ gs are better off &quot; drug free , &quot; and that all societies should stri@@ ve to be drug free .
but few - if any - drug free societies ever exist@@ ed .
the second my@@ th pre@@ sum@@ es that pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion redu@@ ces the har@@ m associated with drugs .
global markets in c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is , op@@ i@@ um and co@@ ca products are basi@@ cally similar to other global commodi@@ ties markets , yet global drug control policies operate on the assu@@ mption that the drug markets bear more in common with sm@@ all@@ po@@ x and other inf@@ ec@@ tious diseases for which there is no demand .
governments can act unilater@@ ally and multilater@@ ally to regul@@ ate commodity markets , but it is a mistake to percei@@ ve pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion as the ultim@@ ate or ma@@ xim@@ um form of regulation .
pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion in fact represents the ab@@ dic@@ ation of regulation .
whatever is not sup@@ pressed is effectively un@@ regul@@ ated , exc@@ ept by crimin@@ al organizations .
around the world , drug law viol@@ ations account for the largest share of the roughly 8 million people inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated in local j@@ ails and pri@@ s@@ ons .
in 1980 , 5@@ 0,000 people were inc@@ ar@@ cer@@ ated in the US for drug law viol@@ ations .
today , the total appro@@ aches half @-@ a @-@ million , with a few hund@@ red thous@@ and more lock@@ ed up on other pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion @-@ related offen@@ ses .
that total represents almost 10 % of all the world &apos;s in@@ m@@ ates .
throughout the developing world , poor pe@@ as@@ ants involved in produc@@ ing op@@ i@@ um , co@@ ca and c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is are ar@@ re@@ sted , sometimes be@@ aten , and often ex@@ tor@@ ted by government ag@@ ents en@@ forcing drug laws .
in B@@ oli@@ via and Per@@ u , co@@ ca was integr@@ ated into society .
the same was true of op@@ i@@ um in Asia . pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions imposed by the US and other governments deci@@ m@@ ated tradi@@ tions that often &quot; domesti@@ c@@ ated &quot; these drugs so as to reduce their har@@ m , while si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously encoura@@ ging tran@@ si@@ tions to re@@ fin@@ ed drugs like her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine .
US law en@@ for@@ cement and intelligence agencies ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely provide information to other governments kno@@ wing that it will be used not just to ar@@ rest but to tor@@ ture those they identi@@ fy .
all these consequences of the drug war can be defined as human rights ab@@ uses .
but the core human rights issue is different - the no@@ tion that people should not be puni@@ shed for what they put into their bo@@ dies .
that right of sovereignty over one &apos;s mind and body - which also inc@@ or@@ por@@ ates the right not to be forced to take drugs against one &apos;s will - represents in some resp@@ ects the most fundamental of all rights .
her@@ o@@ in us@@ ers are deni@@ ed the most effective medic@@ ation available to re@@ me@@ dy their ad@@ dic@@ tion , i@@ .@@ e@@ . , meth@@ ad@@ one .
people unable or un@@ willing to stop in@@ jec@@ ting drugs are deni@@ ed access to st@@ eri@@ le sy@@ ring@@ es , with de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing consequences .
millions who smo@@ ke m@@ ari@@ ju@@ ana or consu@@ me other p@@ sy@@ cho@@ active drugs are har@@ med far more by state action than by drug use .
more and more vo@@ ices are call@@ ing for a systemati@@ c re@@ view and re@@ vision of the international anti @-@ drug conven@@ tions that sustain today &apos;s failed policies .
some emphasi@@ ze the anti @-@ scientific and otherwise il@@ legitimate basis for including c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is and co@@ ca in the conven@@ tions .
others point to the contra@@ dic@@ tions between anti @-@ drug conven@@ tions and international human rights conven@@ tions .
others no@@ te that the anti @-@ drug conven@@ tions exac@@ erb@@ ate the problems they seek to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate .
a new global drug control regime is needed .
it must re@@ ject the fo@@ oli@@ sh rhetoric of creating &quot; a drug @-@ free world &quot; and ackno@@ wledge that the true challenge is lear@@ ning to live with drugs so that they cause the least har@@ m .
an effective strategy needs to establish reali@@ stic objectives and cri@@ teri@@ a for e@@ valu@@ ating success or failure , and these cri@@ teri@@ a must focus on reducing the death , disease , crime and suffering associated with both drug use and drug policies .
it also must embra@@ ce the principle that people should not be puni@@ shed for what they put into their bo@@ dies , but only for the har@@ ms they do others .
those are the key el@@ ements of a more ethi@@ cal and effective drug control regime than the one that ha@@ un@@ ts today &apos;s world .
