critics who want a more activi@@ st , growth @-@ ori@@ ented monetary policy have tri@@ ed@@ --@@ al@@ beit un@@ success@@ ful@@ l@@ y@@ --@@ to so@@ ften up the 6@@ 8 @-@ year @-@ old D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man with personal attacks and de@@ gra@@ ding insu@@ l@@ ts .
but the ECB head and the Govern@@ ing Council ref@@ used to yi@@ eld either to insu@@ l@@ ts or to heavy @-@ hand@@ ed political pressure to cut interest rates , cut them again , and then cut them some more .
the fle@@ d@@ g@@ ling bank ear@@ ned enormous credibility , but also considerable en@@ mi@@ ty , by sti@@ cking to its anti @-@ inflation mandate .
of course , the ECB has had its pro@@ ble@@ m@@ s@@ --@@ mainly in the communic@@ ations are@@ a@@ --@@ and Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s c@@ and@@ or sometimes did get him into trou@@ ble .
but these were small matters that were v@@ ast@@ ly dist@@ or@@ ted by critics with their own agen@@ das for the bank .
whatever problems may have exist@@ ed in the early ye@@ ar@@ s@@ --@@ too many vo@@ ices , too little c@@ lar@@ ity of mess@@ a@@ ge@@ --@@ were smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed out over time .
in a recent personal inter@@ view in his Frank@@ fur@@ t office , I asked Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g what had been his single most important ac@@ compli@@ shment in office .
without he@@ si@@ tation he respon@@ ded that it was the smo@@ ot@@ h introduc@@ tion and easy accept@@ ance of the common currency .
now it can be told that the central bank had 25 to 30 disaster scen@@ ari@@ os ready in case things went b@@ adly .
none , in fact , was needed .
the introduc@@ tion of the euro currency was ac@@ compli@@ shed more smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly than even the ECB had expected .
but it was no single ac@@ compli@@ shment that made Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s term in office a success .
rather , it was his con@@ sen@@ su@@ al style of leadership .
for@@ ging t@@ wel@@ ve independent , pro@@ u@@ d , and , in some cases , powerful national central banks into a co@@ he@@ sive collective was no easy task .
it would not have been possible with an authoritarian person@@ ality at the ECB hel@@ m .
there is a my@@ th now making the ro@@ unds that the se@@ arch for consensus slow@@ ed down the ECB &apos;s decision @-@ making process when setting monetary policy .
but the ECB was &quot; slow &quot; to cut rates not because of the need for consensus , but because it is a non @-@ activi@@ st bank that cuts rates only when the inflation pi@@ c@@ ture justi@@ fi@@ es it .
according to M@@ r@@ . Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g , there was not a single inst@@ ance when an important monetary policy decision was del@@ ay@@ ed because of the need for consensus .
not@@ with@@ standing the ECB &apos;s significant achie@@ vements during the Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g years , important problems remain for the new president , Jean @-@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et of France .
the promise of the e@@ uro@@ --@@ that it would set off a competitive dynamic in@@ side the euro @-@ zone economy that would comp@@ el structural re@@ form@@ --@@ has yet to be fulfi@@ lled .
so far , Europe &apos;s politicians have resist@@ ed reform , and s@@ car@@ c@@ ely an opportunity went by that W@@ im Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g did@@ n &apos;t sc@@ old Europe &apos;s politicians for this failure .
the Gro@@ w@@ th and St@@ ability P@@ act ( which mand@@ ates a 3 % of GDP limit on the size of the budget deficits of euro @-@ zone members ) is another con@@ ten@@ tious issue that a@@ wa@@ its resolution .
contro@@ vers@@ y over the P@@ act has set off a n@@ ast@@ y disp@@ ute between small and big countries in the euro @-@ zone .
there are well @-@ found@@ ed comp@@ la@@ ints about double standards .
the small countries follow the rules but the big countries act as if they are ex@@ emp@@ t .
according to N@@ out W@@ ell@@ in@@ k , president of the D@@ ut@@ ch Central Bank , failure to satis@@ fac@@ t@@ ori@@ ly sett@@ le this issue could have serious negative consequences for the euro .
Fin@@ all@@ y@@ --@@ and perhaps most import@@ ant@@ --@@ is the problem of integr@@ ating the economies of the ten new member states into the euro area .
this will not be easy .
the bank must be care@@ ful not to bi@@ te off more than it can ch@@ ew .
W@@ im Du@@ is@@ en@@ ber@@ g &apos;s appoin@@ tment as first ECB president in May 1998 was mi@@ red in political contro@@ vers@@ y .
but as he ex@@ its his post , there is a growing consensus that history will record the stra@@ i@@ ght @-@ tal@@ king D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man as being the right man for the right job at the right time .
he deser@@ ves Europe &apos;s un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal gra@@ titu@@ de for laun@@ ching the ECB so success@@ fully .
the D@@ ut@@ ch J@@ obs Mi@@ ra@@ cle
Paris : unemployment in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands di@@ pped below 3 % recently , a fig@@ ure for the most part un@@ he@@ ard of in Europe since the oil sho@@ cks of the 197@@ 0s .
indeed , not so long ago unemployment in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands stood above 10 % .
have the D@@ ut@@ ch inv@@ ented a F@@ our@@ th W@@ ay to improved economic performance and are there lessons for the rest of Europe in the D@@ ut@@ ch experience ?
for some obser@@ vers across Europe , the economic performance of the Ne@@ ther@@ lands is so surpri@@ sing that they believe it a product of smo@@ ke and mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors , or of some statisti@@ cal tri@@ ck .
but as with those who doub@@ ted the reality behind American economic growth five years ago , this view is also emp@@ h@@ ati@@ cally wrong .
not only is unemployment way down in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , but the rate of participation by the entire population in the lab@@ our market is growing sharply as well .
true , the propor@@ tion of workers who remain classi@@ fied by the state as si@@ ck or inv@@ ali@@ d - currently 12 % - remains much too high , to be fr@@ ank .
but this propor@@ tion is less today than it was in the 198@@ 0s ; so a higher unemployment rate is not being dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed by medical cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
other dis@@ belie@@ ving obser@@ vers say that what we are se@@ eing in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands is the effect of a shor@@ ten@@ ing of the work week .
the average work week in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands ( coun@@ ting both those who work full @-@ time and those who work part @-@ time ) is 27 hours , compared to 2@@ 9 hours in France .
advoc@@ ates of a shor@@ ter work week as the road to full employment , indeed , often ci@@ te the D@@ ut@@ ch example to dec@@ l@@ are victory for their argum@@ ents .
those against a shor@@ ten@@ ed work week , however , dis@@ mis@@ s the increase in the number of jobs that results from shor@@ ter working hours as a fal@@ se solution - a cru@@ de s@@ wa@@ p of working hours for an increase in the number of workers .
both hosti@@ le camp@@ s are wrong .
there is a significant increase in part @-@ time work in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , to be sure , but it is due , prim@@ arily , to a large increase in labor participation among women .
thus part @-@ time work does not me@@ ch@@ ani@@ cally explain the country &apos;s lower unemployment rate .
so what is the sec@@ ret of successful job creation in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands ?
the immediate reason is easy to identi@@ fy .
since the beginning of the 198@@ 0s , wage increases have been smaller than technological progress would have allowed .
company profits have thus gone up , leading to new investment and the creation of new jobs .
this is a classi@@ c mechanism , but one which has worked perf@@ ec@@ tly .
the more de@@ lic@@ ate question is to identi@@ fy those factors that made wage moder@@ ation in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands possible .
I see two princip@@ al reasons :
• The first is a reform of unemployment insurance . the Ne@@ ther@@ lands has put into effect a reform that lin@@ ks unemployment compens@@ ation to se@@ arch@@ ing for a new job .
ref@@ us@@ al by an un@@ employ@@ ed person to take an &quot; acceptable &quot; job offer automati@@ cally results in the end of state support for him or her .
the longer an individual remains un@@ employ@@ ed , the wider the defini@@ tion of what constitu@@ tes an &quot; acceptable &quot; becomes .
in practice what this means is that an un@@ employ@@ ed person must accept a &quot; compar@@ able &quot; job for the first six months of unemployment , and must take any job on offer after ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en months on the d@@ ol@@ e or lose state benefits .
• The second factor is cooperation among social partners .
the D@@ ut@@ ch har@@ p on this point , but they are right .
for at the ro@@ ot of the D@@ ut@@ ch mi@@ ra@@ cle lies the by now qu@@ asi @-@ my@@ th@@ ological W@@ as@@ sen@@ a@@ ar A@@ gre@@ ement , signed in 198@@ 2 , among employ@@ ers , uni@@ ons , and the government .
at the time , it was clear to all concerned that the D@@ ut@@ ch economy was in bad shape .
the W@@ as@@ sen@@ a@@ ar A@@ gre@@ ement was a plan of action : moder@@ ation of wage demands was assu@@ red in exchange for measures designed to alle@@ vi@@ ate the human cost of unemployment , from the financing of early reti@@ rement to the shor@@ ten@@ ing of the work week .
by and large , this strategy has been ad@@ her@@ ed to ever since .
important lessons are to be found in the D@@ ut@@ ch experience for all of Europe .
today , economic conditions in Western Europe are good - in some places , better than that even - and they are improving in many countries of Eastern Europe that are seeking EU membership .
but Europe &apos;s economies are regul@@ arly subject to new rec@@ essions .
these rec@@ essions will require pain@@ ful adjust@@ ments .
without a mechanism for social cooperation , the adjust@@ ments that any recession will impose are likely to result in high unemployment .
with a soli@@ d mechanism of social cooperation , however , there is at least a chance to avoid it .
it is now , when economies are doing better , that such a structure for social cooperation must be considered and con@@ struc@@ ted .
the D@@ ut@@ ch Lab@@ or Mark@@ et fu@@ dge cre@@ ates J@@ obs
Am@@ ster@@ dam : the D@@ ut@@ ch like to think of themselves as leaders in social policy .
but as we disco@@ vered on a recent tri@@ p to the Ne@@ ther@@ lands and Germany , it is in economic policy that today &apos;s Europe looks to Holl@@ and for leadership .
with unemployment in Germany , France and Italy around 10 % , the D@@ ut@@ ch j@@ ob@@ less rate , at less than 3 % , is the en@@ v@@ y of Europe .
Holl@@ and is that r@@ are example of a bo@@ om@@ ing welfare state ( &quot; over@@ he@@ ating &quot; was the wor@@ d used to descri@@ be the D@@ ut@@ ch economy by three central bankers in Frank@@ fur@@ t ) .
how did this happen ?
some credit the so @-@ called &quot; Pol@@ der Mo@@ del &quot; of social cooperation between employ@@ ers , uni@@ ons and the government .
they &apos;@@ re wrong .
social cooperation per se did not save the D@@ ut@@ ch from the mistak@@ es of the 60 &quot; s and 70 &quot; s .
so how can it be credi@@ ted for economic recovery in the mid 80 &quot; s and 90 &quot; s ?
true , D@@ ut@@ ch trade uni@@ ons have moder@@ ated wage demands . but this is not what sp@@ ark@@ ed Holl@@ and &apos;s dramatic employment gains .
instead , credit structural reforms in the D@@ ut@@ ch labor market for the jobs boom .
primary am@@ ong@@ st these is the widespread use of part @-@ time and temporary employe@@ es .
the move to part @-@ time employment in Holl@@ and was intended to increase fem@@ ale participation in the D@@ ut@@ ch labor force .
increasing avail@@ ability of part @-@ time and temporary jobs , however , raised the labor force participation rates of both men and women .
regul@@ ar full @-@ time employe@@ es are almost impossible to s@@ ack under D@@ ut@@ ch law , but employ@@ ers can fire part @-@ time workers and not ren@@ ew temporary contrac@@ ts when they exp@@ ire .
there is an &quot; ir@@ on law &quot; of employment : if employ@@ ers can &apos;t fire workers , they won &apos;t hi@@ re them .
ir@@ oni@@ cally , employment bo@@ om@@ ed in Holl@@ and , precisely because an increasing propor@@ tion of the work force - made up of part @-@ time and temporary workers - can be fi@@ red if necessary .
among the Euro @-@ 11 countries , Holl@@ and was the first to both understand this point and act upon it .
yet Holl@@ and has not gone all the way .
an extra@@ ordin@@ arily high propor@@ tion of the labor force - 12 % - is offici@@ ally classi@@ fied as &quot; si@@ ck &quot; or &quot; inv@@ ali@@ d &quot; because putting a wor@@ ker on dis@@ ability is practi@@ cally the only way D@@ ut@@ ch employ@@ ers have of ri@@ d@@ ding their firms of un@@ wanted full @-@ time employe@@ es .
such fin@@ ag@@ ling is costly to business , government and the employe@@ es themselves .
so , while still extrem@@ ely low for contin@@ ent@@ al Europe , the official D@@ ut@@ ch unemployment rate under@@ estimates the true level of j@@ ob@@ less@@ ness in the D@@ ut@@ ch economy , because it exclu@@ des the dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed unemployment of the &quot; si@@ ck &quot; and &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led . &quot;
were D@@ ut@@ ch law to per@@ mit the s@@ ac@@ king of full time employe@@ es ( not likely in these prosp@@ erous times ) the propor@@ tion of the work force offici@@ ally sanc@@ tioned as too si@@ ck or dis@@ ab@@ led to work would dramatically decline , as would the number of part @-@ time and temporary workers .
the ability to fire workers not only means less unemployment but more flexi@@ ble labor markets .
the movement of workers from low to higher productivity uses - whether from firm @-@ to @-@ firm , sector @-@ to @-@ sector or region @-@ to @-@ region - is th@@ war@@ ted if employ@@ ers do not have the power to s@@ ack .
this is not an issue of class struggle , but of economic growth .
US Fed Cha@@ ir@@ man Greensp@@ an asked recently , &quot; why U@@ .@@ S@@ . businesses and workers appear to have benef@@ it@@ ted more from the recent adv@@ ances in information technology than their counter@@ parts in Europe and Japan ? &quot;
his answer : &quot; the relatively inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble and , h@@ ence , more costly labor markets of these economies appears to be a significant part of the explan@@ ation ... Europe has particip@@ ated in the wa@@ ve of inv@@ en@@ tion and innovation , but appears to have been s@@ lower to explo@@ it it . &quot;
what Greensp@@ an suggests is that the labor market flexi@@ bility gap between the US and Europe may be more important in expla@@ ining relative economic performance than the al@@ leg@@ ed technology gap .
there appears to be a right way , a wrong way , and a D@@ ut@@ ch way of doing things .
the US does labor market policy the right way .
contin@@ ent@@ al Europe , exclu@@ ding Holl@@ and , does it the wrong way .
and the D@@ ut@@ ch , neither right nor wrong , temp@@ er ide@@ ology with practi@@ c@@ ality to for@@ ge com@@ promises that have consensus support .
although this system works for the D@@ ut@@ ch , can it work for the rest of Europe ?
why not ?
politically , no European country can - or really wants to - adopt the American model .
at the same time , there is a growing demand in Europe for better economic performance .
European unemployment rates are un@@ accept@@ ably high ; America &apos;s long boom pu@@ ts pressure on domestic politicians to do better .
the D@@ ut@@ ch solution best f@@ its Europe &apos;s present political reali@@ ties : keep welfare rules in place , but give people the chance to get around them .
the D@@ ut@@ ch re@@ tain the job @-@ kil@@ ling laws that make it impossible to s@@ ack regul@@ ar full @-@ time employe@@ es , but allow employ@@ ers to s@@ ack part @-@ time and temporary workers .
this fu@@ dge , not social cooperation , is the true &quot; D@@ ut@@ ch model &quot; for success .
the D@@ ut@@ ch solution can work for other European countries .
in fact , it already has .
when the French changed their labor law to mandate the 35 h@@ our work week , heavy restrictions on the use of part @-@ time and temporary employe@@ es by French employ@@ ers were remo@@ ved .
this expla@@ ins the recent up@@ sur@@ ge in French job creation .
super@@ fici@@ ally , France looks as if it has become more of a welfare state , but the reality is that the French have mi@@ mi@@ ck@@ ed the D@@ ut@@ ch in increasing labor market flexi@@ bility .
this D@@ ut@@ ch solution may be second best , but in Europe it &apos;s the only alternative that works .
the D@@ yn@@ a@@ mism of Nations
proposals for economic reform of Con@@ tin@@ ent@@ al Europe keep coming .
the process does not constitu@@ te a uni@@ fied , reason@@ ed debate so much as an ongoing political au@@ ction in which special interests seek vot@@ es for the policy change that will benefit them .
some say the bar to a good economy is the Con@@ tin@@ ent &apos;s in@@ fl@@ ated welfare state and the solution is re@@ tren@@ ch@@ ment , beginning with raising reti@@ rement ages .
others say the impe@@ di@@ ment is the entire over@@ grown public sector and the solution is to cut tax rates .
the latest view , end@@ or@@ sed by the European Commission , bl@@ ames a shor@@ tage of infrastructure and propos@@ es more bri@@ d@@ ges and t@@ un@@ n@@ els .
this approach will never reach the heart of the matter .
the West &apos;s core social values make high economic performance a moral im@@ per@@ ative like free speech or tri@@ al by j@@ ury .
further , the Con@@ tin@@ ent will und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly need some trans@@ form@@ ative changes of its economic institutions to establish high @-@ performance economies .
to reach broad agreement on those changes requires facing some basic questions so far ig@@ no@@ red .
a real debate on basic reform has to start with an exp@@ li@@ cit conc@@ eption of economic performance - of what constitu@@ tes a good business life .
productivity is an important el@@ ement .
only a high @-@ productivity economy can promise all or most working @-@ age per@@ s@@ ons a range of care@@ ers at high wage rates .
but high productivity is not the only el@@ ement of high performance .
the other el@@ ement is th@@ ri@@ ving , prosp@@ ering particip@@ ants .
this requires jobs to be re@@ war@@ ding in more than p@@ ec@@ uni@@ ary ways - en@@ li@@ sting the min@@ ds of employe@@ es , eng@@ aging them in problem sol@@ ving , leading them to disco@@ ver some of their tal@@ ents and exp@@ anding their abilities .
this personal growth , while an end in itself , is also a source of job satis@@ fac@@ tion , which in turn boo@@ sts participation in the labor force , and of high employe@@ e loy@@ al@@ ty , which lo@@ wers unemployment , making more good jobs available .
what is needed for high performance ?
basi@@ cally , it is productive change , which I call economic d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism .
for employe@@ es to develop , they must be im@@ be@@ d@@ ded in a stimul@@ ating work@@ place , with new problems to solve , har@@ der t@@ as@@ ks to be ma@@ ster@@ ed , added abilities to stri@@ ve for .
less ob@@ viously , a country does not want mis@@ gui@@ ded or poin@@ t@@ less change ; it wants investments that appear to the financial sector as productive .
the late 1990 &apos;s produced evidence that low d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism was associated with weak economic performance , particularly low prosperity .
of the 12 large OECD economies , thre@@ e@@ --@@ Germany , Italy , and Fr@@ anc@@ e@@ --@@ were con@@ spi@@ cu@@ ously un @-@ dynamic : they mis@@ sed the 1990 &apos;s investment boom or were aw@@ fully late to it .
these same economies also rank@@ ed at or near the bottom in unemployment and labor @-@ force participation , both before the boom and now .
what are the requirements for d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism ?
Y@@ ale University &apos;s Robert Shi@@ ll@@ er has suggest@@ ed that I believe that Europeans lack d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism owing to a defici@@ ency of entrep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al &quot; spiri@@ t . &quot;
I have pon@@ dered the ex@@ pressed un@@ eas@@ iness of Europeans about making money , and specul@@ ated that their scho@@ ol@@ ing might dra@@ in away some pla@@ y@@ ful@@ ness and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity . but that is not my explan@@ ation of Europe &apos;s problem .
for one thing , it is hard to decide whether such cultural pat@@ tern@@ s are causes or effects of dynamic economies .
my the@@ sis is that the degree of d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism in a nation &apos;s economy hin@@ ges on its development of some key economic institutions - company law and corporate governance , the population &apos;s pre@@ par@@ ation for business life , the development of financial instru@@ ments such as the stock market and so for@@ th . such general institutions as the rule of law and provi@@ sion of enough personal and national security to saf@@ e@@ gu@@ ard ear@@ ning , saving and invest@@ ing are needed for any market economy , even market soci@@ alism ; they are in@@ sufficient for d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism .
evidence exi@@ sts for this the@@ sis .
one could have predic@@ ted in advance of the recent boom how the 12 large OECD economies would r@@ ank simply by kno@@ wing the percentage of the population with a universi@@ ty degree , the OECD inde@@ x of barriers to entrep@@ rene@@ urs , and the bre@@ ad@@ th of the stock exchange ( meas@@ ured by the market value of out@@ standing sha@@ res relative to GDP years before the boom ) .
this evidence lin@@ king employment to d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism and trac@@ ing d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism to favor@@ able institutions , such as a well @-@ developed stock market , and to ob@@ structive institutions , such as my@@ ri@@ ad lic@@ en@@ ses for entr@@ y by new firms , is an advance in our understanding of healthy economies .
it is us@@ eful to know that there is v@@ ast@@ ly more to creating economic d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism than private property ; and that high unemployment is not to be la@@ id sol@@ ely to labor market restrictions .
is there evidence directly associ@@ ating high performance - that is , high employment and high productivity - with the presence of institutions believed help@@ ful to d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism and the absence of those believed harm@@ ful ?
such evidence emerg@@ es even with the small s@@ ample of just 12 large OECD economies .
a cross @-@ country analysis estimates that universi@@ ty education is good for all three el@@ ements of economic performance : the employment rate ( relative to the working @-@ age population ) , the unemployment rate ( relative to labor force ) , and labor productivity too .
s@@ cor@@ ing high on the OECD inde@@ x of barriers to entrep@@ rene@@ urs is bad for all three el@@ ements of performance .
a high level of job protection is bad for productivity but does not have a clear effect on either employment rate or unemployment rate .
I have suggest@@ ed that the organi@@ z@@ ational structure of the Con@@ tin@@ ent@@ al economies limits their performance .
this corpor@@ ati@@ st structure - labor uni@@ ons , workers coun@@ ci@@ ls , employ@@ er con@@ fe@@ der@@ ations , and big banks - facilit@@ ates direct interven@@ tions in economic decision making to give interest groups protection and ve@@ to power .
in fact , among the 12 large OECD nations , a higher degree of corpor@@ ati@@ sm as com@@ mon@@ ly meas@@ ured is loo@@ sely associated with lower employment and lower productivity .
the reason for these negative effects appears to be that high corpor@@ ati@@ sm is strong@@ ly cor@@ related with sti@@ fl@@ ed entrep@@ rene@@ ur@@ ship and ob@@ structive job protection .
the corpor@@ ati@@ st structure by itself does not de@@ trac@@ t from performance .
here again , the truth lies in the nu@@ ances .
this is precisely why Europe should be deb@@ ating about the Con@@ tin@@ ent &apos;s real problems , not lock@@ ing their economies into corpor@@ ati@@ sm by ens@@ hr@@ ining the &quot; social market economy &quot; into the emerging EU constitution .

the East Asian Mi@@ ra@@ cle Re@@ visi@@ ted
Hong K@@ O@@ N@@ G - Al@@ most two decades ago , the World Bank publi@@ shed its land@@ mark study The East Asian Mi@@ ra@@ cle , analy@@ zing why East Asian economies gre@@ w faster than emerging markets in Latin America , Africa , and elsewhere .
these economies , the study conclu@@ ded , achieved high growth rates by getting the basi@@ cs right , promoting investment , n@@ ur@@ turing human capital , and opening up to export manufacturing .
but that was not all .
the World Bank also ackno@@ wle@@ dged , g@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , that governments interven@@ ed - systemati@@ cally and through multi@@ ple ch@@ ann@@ els - to fo@@ ster development , including in specific industries in specific loc@@ ations via subsidies , tax incentives , and financial repres@@ sion .
in the interven@@ ing years , particularly after the Asian Financial Cri@@ sis , the pro @-@ market , anti @-@ intervention Washington Con@@ sensus fell out of favor .
a &quot; New Institu@@ tional Economi@@ cs &quot; ( N@@ I@@ E ) gained ground by fi@@ lling in the g@@ aps left by main@@ stream models , which ig@@ no@@ red the central importance of institutions in man@@ aging the change and uncertainty that aff@@ ect resource alloc@@ ation and social choice .
indeed , in light of today &apos;s Great Rec@@ ession and the current European debt crisis , the main question remains that of the role of the state in promoting growth and development .
it was the collapse of the Soviet blo@@ c &apos;s plann@@ ed economies that sp@@ ur@@ red both free @-@ market hu@@ bri@@ s and the re@@ alization that institutions matter .
but it was China &apos;s ability to sustain rapid economic growth for three decades that nec@@ essi@@ t@@ ated a revi@@ sion@@ ist look at st@@ ati@@ st capitalism .
Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate economist D@@ ou@@ gl@@ ass North argued early on that human society created institutions to deal with information asy@@ mm@@ et@@ ry , but that their cre@@ ations immediately gave rise to the problem of how to constra@@ in such institutions to fulfi@@ ll their intended objectives .
in 2000 , O@@ li@@ ver E@@ . W@@ illi@@ am@@ son classi@@ fied four levels of social analysis for institutions - in@@ formal institutions , cust@@ oms , tradi@@ tions , nor@@ ms , and religion ; formal institutions with rules govern@@ ing property rights , social order , the judi@@ ci@@ ary , and the bureau@@ cracy ; governance structures and their ali@@ gn@@ ment to economi@@ ze on trans@@ action costs ; and de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zed decision @-@ making in resource alloc@@ ation ( the dom@@ ain of ne@@ o @-@ classi@@ cal economics ) .
according to W@@ illi@@ am@@ son , N@@ I@@ E is prim@@ arily concerned with the economic and political ra@@ mi@@ fic@@ ations of formal rules and governance structures .
but , for many emerging economies , it is the em@@ be@@ d@@ de@@ d@@ ness of in@@ formal rules , nor@@ ms , and belie@@ fs , and their slow@@ ness to change , that prev@@ ents many economies &quot; break@@ through to more advanced , knowledge @-@ based growth .
Fr@@ anc@@ is Fu@@ ku@@ y@@ ama &apos;s new book The O@@ ri@@ g@@ ins of Politi@@ cal Or@@ der attemp@@ ts to address this problem .
he exam@@ ines the emer@@ gence of three c@@ ateg@@ ories of political institutions - the state , the rule of law , and accoun@@ table government , the lat@@ ter two being constra@@ ints on the state that prevent it from becoming des@@ po@@ tic .
Fu@@ ku@@ y@@ ama argu@@ es that patri@@ moni@@ alism - defined as the natural human pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to favor family and fri@@ ends - is the ban@@ e of the rule of law and accoun@@ table government .
but , while patri@@ moni@@ alism may well be the main barri@@ er to countries &quot; advance to middle @-@ class democracy - and a key reason for auto@@ cratic states &quot; fragi@@ lity - it may also be a more general feat@@ ure of all political and economic systems .
wi@@ tn@@ ess the current debate about whether governments in advanced economies have been cap@@ tured by financial interests - a question that G@@ illi@@ an T@@ et@@ t poses in a recent re@@ view arti@@ cle in For@@ eign A@@ ff@@ air@@ s . &quot; should governments r@@ ein in finance to cr@@ ush the elite , &quot; she as@@ ks , &quot; or should they simply accept income differ@@ enti@@ als and financial savings as the inevitable price of dynamic societies ? &quot;
this is not a tri@@ vi@@ al question , given the role of un@@ ab@@ ated inequality in growing social un@@ rest and even revolution around the world .
indeed , the real surprise is that protests such as &quot; O@@ cc@@ up@@ y Wall Street &quot; have resul@@ ted in so little change , suggest@@ ing that institutions , once established , are &quot; sti@@ ck@@ y &quot; in pre@@ ser@@ ving the status quo .
this is particularly relevant to Asia &apos;s growth story .
former British coloni@@ es like India and Malaysia inher@@ ited common law and institutional ch@@ ec@@ ks and balances , but several today confron@@ t institutional deca@@ y , rising corruption , and cre@@ eping patri@@ moni@@ alism .
other economies , such as China , are seeking ways to establish the rule of law by strengthening the institutional framework within the framework of one @-@ party rule .
both Fu@@ ku@@ y@@ ama and North conclu@@ de that strong state @-@ led economies can be accoun@@ table , but become fragi@@ le should the ruling elites fail to respond to popular maj@@ orities and to global nor@@ ms of behavior and governance .
North argu@@ es that competition is a key force driving adap@@ tive efficiency among institutions .
a basic in@@ sight of N@@ I@@ E is that meas@@ uring trans@@ action costs in various factor and product markets can reve@@ al in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies and barriers to better performance .
an exam@@ in@@ ation of trans@@ action costs in global and domestic supply cha@@ ins would reve@@ al the extent to which r@@ ent @-@ seeking activities and policy dist@@ or@@ tions de@@ ter the emer@@ gence of competitive markets .
for advanced economies , the study of W@@ illi@@ am@@ son &apos;s levels two and three - formal institutions and their governance - can lead to important insi@@ ghts .
but , for emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere , we are convinc@@ ed that the study of in@@ formal institutions , behavior , and nor@@ ms offers a better understanding of the challenges of man@@ aging growth and performance .
simply put , in many emerging markets , it is not a lack of understanding of international best practices that hol@@ ds back economic performance .
rather , it is the conflict between these practices and traditional or domestic social relations and practices that ent@@ ren@@ ch v@@ est@@ ed interests op@@ posed to change .

for stability to be pre@@ served , Sin@@ o @-@ Japanese relations must improve .
although North Korea &apos;s nuclear ambi@@ tions are wor@@ r@@ ying and destabili@@ zing , China &apos;s rise is the key strategic issue in East Asia .
for three decades , its economy has grown by 8 % to 10 % annually .
its defense expendi@@ tures have an even faster pace .
yet Chinese leaders spe@@ ak of China &apos;s &quot; peaceful rise &quot; and &quot; peaceful development . &quot;
some believe that China cannot rise peac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , and will seek he@@ ge@@ mon@@ y in East Asia , leading to conflict with the United States and Japan .
others point out that China has eng@@ aged in &quot; good neighb@@ or &quot; policies since the 1990 &quot; s , sett@@ led border disp@@ utes , played a greater role in international institutions , and recognized the benefits of using soft power .
a decade ago , I over@@ saw pre@@ par@@ ation of the US P@@ ent@@ ag@@ on &apos;s East Asian Str@@ ate@@ gy Re@@ port , which has gui@@ ded American policy under the Clinton and Bush administ@@ ra@@ tions .
back then , there was a debate between those who wanted to con@@ tain China &apos;s growing strength increased and those who ur@@ ged China &apos;s integration into the international system .
con@@ tain@@ ment was un@@ fe@@ a@@ sible , because , unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War , China &apos;s neighbors did not see it as a clear and present danger .
moreover , tre@@ ating China as an en@@ emy would ensure that it became one , thus un@@ necessarily ignor@@ ing the possibility of ben@@ ig@@ n outcomes .
the strategy we ch@@ ose was to &quot; balance and integr@@ ate . &quot;
the East Asian balance of power re@@ sted on the tri@@ ang@@ le of China , Japan , and the US .
by re@@ af@@ fir@@ ming the US @-@ Japan security relationship in the Clinton @-@ H@@ as@@ hi@@ mo@@ to dec@@ lar@@ ation of 199@@ 6 , the US helped structure a favor@@ able regional balance .
by si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously encoura@@ ging China &apos;s entr@@ y into the World Trade Organization and other institutions , we created incentives for good behavior .
so integration was he@@ dged by re@@ alism in case things went wrong .
that strategy has largely worked .
China &apos;s military power has increased , but its behavior has been more moderate than it was a decade ago .
China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to American pre@@ pon@@ der@@ ance that the Ka@@ is@@ er &apos;s Germany posed when it sur@@ pass@@ ed Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century .
the key to military power in today &apos;s information age depends on the ability to integr@@ ate complex systems of space @-@ based surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance , high spe@@ ed compu@@ ters , and &quot; sm@@ art &quot; weapons .
it is not likely that China ( or others ) will soon close that gap with the US .
of course , the fact that China is unlikely to compe@@ te with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia , or that war over Taiwan is not possible .
if Taiwan were to dec@@ l@@ are independence , it is likely that China would use force , regardless of the perceived economic or military costs .
but it would be unlikely to win such a war , and p@@ ru@@ dent policy on all sides can make such a war unlikely .
so what is the strategic problem today ?
stability in East Asia depends upon good relations between all three sides of the US @-@ China @-@ Japan tri@@ ang@@ le , but ties between China and Japan de@@ teri@@ or@@ ated in the Ko@@ i@@ zu@@ m@@ i years .
China per@@ mit@@ ted demon@@ stra@@ tions , sometimes violent , against Japanese consu@@ l@@ ates in prot@@ est of changes in Japanese tex@@ t@@ boo@@ ks that so@@ f@@ ten@@ ed descri@@ p@@ tions of Japan &apos;s inv@@ asion in the 19@@ 30 &quot; s .
after 22 million Chinese signed a pe@@ ti@@ tion against Japanese membership of the United Nations Security Council , Pre@@ mi@@ er W@@ en Ji@@ ab@@ a@@ o announced China &apos;s opposition to such a step .
China also ob@@ jected to Japanese stat@@ ements about Taiwan .
and there are territori@@ al disp@@ utes about small is@@ lands and potential gas reserves near the China @-@ Japan m@@ ari@@ time bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y .
the most con@@ ten@@ tious issue , however , has been prime ministeri@@ al visi@@ ts to the Y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i S@@ hr@@ ine , and , until Abe &apos;s visit , China had been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to engage in any summit me@@ et@@ ings with Japan so long as such visi@@ ts continue .
although China has become Japan &apos;s largest partner in trade and foreign direct investment , nationali@@ sts in the two countries have fu@@ eled each other &apos;s extre@@ mism , while their governments play with fire .
American interests rest on regional stability and continued growth in trade and investment .
so President George W. Bush could qui@@ et@@ ly tell Abe that we wel@@ come good relations between Japan and China , and that prime ministeri@@ al visi@@ ts to the Y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i S@@ hr@@ ine under@@ cut Japan &apos;s own interests in East Asia .
it re@@ min@@ ds Asi@@ ans of the re@@ pul@@ sive Japan of the 19@@ 30 &quot; s rather than the attrac@@ tive Japan of today .
at the same time , the US can be cau@@ tious about invol@@ ving Japan in Taiwan issues - a ne@@ ur@@ al@@ gi@@ c point for China - while encoura@@ ging the development of Asian institutions that increase con@@ tac@@ ts and damp@@ en conflict .
this can include the development of the East Asian Sum@@ mit , revi@@ val of the Asian P@@ aci@@ fic Economic Co@@ operation ( A@@ P@@ EC ) , and the e@@ volution of the current six @-@ party talks on North Korea into a permanent Nor@@ the@@ ast Asia Security Dialo@@ gue .
fortunately , there are signs that both China and Japan are seeking to back away from the imp@@ as@@ se of recent years .
while Abe has main@@ tained his position on Y@@ as@@ u@@ kun@@ i , his summit with Chinese President H@@ u J@@ inta@@ o was a promising step forward .
some Chinese analy@@ sts , for their part , recognize the danger in stimul@@ ating too much nationalism toward Japan .
the US should qui@@ et@@ ly try to nu@@ dge these steps forward .
the US @-@ Japan alliance remains crucial to stability in East Asia , but it takes three sides to make a tri@@ ang@@ le .
the ECB \ u@@ 0@@ 0@@ 2@@ 6 Europe \ u@@ 0@@ 0@@ 27@@ s up@@ s@@ wing
Cambridge : Europe is on an up@@ s@@ wing in growth and eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a .
but how long can this last ?
sho@@ wing the ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness to be expected of a new rec@@ ru@@ it , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) has already fi@@ red a pre@@ mat@@ ure sho@@ t at the still hi@@ d@@ den fig@@ ure of inflation .
will it wait for inflation to really show before fir@@ ing another vol@@ le@@ y ?
or will the ECB emp@@ ty its g@@ uns at the first ru@@ m@@ bl@@ ings of a stronger business cycle , fe@@ ar@@ ful of acc@@ us@@ ations of running from battle or of being cau@@ ght of gu@@ ard .
the ECB might surprise everyone by a successful policy of pragmati@@ sm , in the man@@ ner of the Al@@ an Greensp@@ an led US Federal Reserve Bo@@ ard .
the ECB , however , should not expect to be popular in the way M@@ r Greensp@@ an is .
it should simply try to be successful .
at this stage , success for the ECB means one thing only : inflation below 2 % .
everything else , including lack of a per@@ sist@@ ent economic up@@ s@@ wing can and should be bl@@ am@@ ed on Europe &apos;s supply side .
within a year of its establishment the ECB found its way to safe ground : it accepted the ad@@ vice of H@@ ans Ti@@ et@@ me@@ yer , former head of the Bundes@@ bank , concern@@ ing the pro@@ per &quot; cru@@ is@@ ing spe@@ ed &quot; for Europe &apos;s economy .
to keep inflation below 2 % , cru@@ is@@ ing spe@@ ed cannot exc@@ eed 1.@@ 5 % .
that lea@@ ves just enough room for ac@@ ci@@ dents that add to inflation to happen and yet sta@@ y below 2 % .
today &apos;s up@@ s@@ wing is the test .
coming from a point where inflation is ba@@ rely over 1 % , Europe &apos;s up@@ turn will inevit@@ ably add to inflation .
the risk of pass@@ ing to 1.@@ 7 % in the year ahead motiv@@ ated the ECB &apos;s recent 50 basis point hi@@ ke .
in capital markets , the commitment to fight inflation , to not be even re@@ mot@@ ely experi@@ mental , was wel@@ com@@ ed with a lower long @-@ term rate .
over the next 6 months we will see how wage ro@@ unds are conduc@@ ted in the new Europe .
to pa@@ int the extre@@ mes , there are two pos@@ sibi@@ lities .
first , and most optimi@@ sti@@ cally , wage ear@@ ners throughout the new E@@ M@@ U zone understand the force of perman@@ ently fi@@ xed exchange rates .
with trade open and un@@ restric@@ ted , with exchange rates gone , labor in each country has lost much , if not all , of its pri@@ cing power .
no union can still pre@@ tend that it has cap@@ tive employ@@ ers who can and will p@@ ass wage increases on into prices without reck@@ oning the consequences for prof@@ it@@ ability and employment .
in this vision of a New European Econ@@ om@@ y , wage discipl@@ ine will be st@@ un@@ ning .
so , the ECB will en@@ counter no problem of inflation being driven ahead by wages .
growth can go forward at a significant spe@@ ed , for wage inflation is no longer an issue .
the pes@@ simi@@ stic argument is this : nothing has changed ; Germany and France had fi@@ xed rates for years ; so too Au@@ stri@@ a , the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , and Spain .
the only that has changed is that governments are now le@@ ft@@ win@@ gi@@ sh almost everywhere , most dramatically in Germany .
in this view , labor views business as mostly cap@@ tive , markets as se@@ g@@ ment@@ ed , and the un@@ employ@@ ed as gener@@ ously supported by the State .
so , no more wage moder@@ ation ; with profits back it is time to get higher wages for workers back , too .
we won &apos;t know for a few months which alternative will prev@@ ail .
but it help@@ s to look ahead and appreci@@ ate the nar@@ row room for man@@ eu@@ ver facing the ECB .
with inflation near Ti@@ et@@ me@@ yer &apos;s cru@@ is@@ ing spe@@ ed , there are only a few ten@@ ths of a perc@@ ent of ex@@ tra inflation that can be accepted , may@@ be 1.@@ 7 rather than only 1.@@ 5 % .
indeed , we can already he@@ ar the ECB &apos;s re@@ fra@@ in : assu@@ re@@ dly , no@@ body will argue that a an ex@@ tra one @-@ tent@@ h perc@@ ent of inflation help@@ s growth ; surely everyone must agree that an un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous success on keeping inflation below 2 % does help growth .
thus , no experi@@ ments .
the ECB will then raise interest rates to slow European growth .
if the EU or the ECB forec@@ ast near 3 % growth for two con@@ sec@@ utive years , wat@@ ch for interest rates to jum@@ p .
the ECB has arri@@ ved at where the Bundes@@ bank was for over a decade .
the central bank cannot create growth in an economy that has a bad supply side ; in the US , with highly competitive markets , the central bank can afford to stand by .
in Europe , where competition and flexi@@ bility are in short supply , indeed are dis@@ da@@ ined by political leaders , the central bank must be pre@@ emp@@ tive .
when in doubt , fire .
the ECB is right to establish its inflation @-@ fighting cre@@ denti@@ als ; it is right to be un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous in educ@@ ating labor markets to its total un@@ willingness to ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate the old ways .
only when that point is established , if necessary at the cost of a growth slowdown , can we expect to start se@@ eing impro@@ vements in labor market behavior .
even a slowdown will not be enough so long as governments ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate un@@ war@@ ran@@ ted real wage gains ( and the resulting unemployment ) with gener@@ ous income support .
the pay@@ off for Europe cannot come from the central bank , it must come from governments recogni@@ zing that the ECB cannot create growth .
only they can create the conditions for growth by allowing for a far more competitive supply side .
but it is hard to see even the sm@@ all@@ est indic@@ ation of a more competitive supply side .
governments , most stri@@ k@@ ingly in Germany , seek to escap@@ e from their political di@@ lemm@@ as by tal@@ king about the transition to a lear@@ ning society and other dre@@ ams .
at the same time , however , they go out of their way to stop radical cu@@ res through aggressive m@@ erg@@ ers or t@@ ough corporate work@@ outs .
none of this will change without a crisis .
but Europe is rich and for that reason won &apos;t have a crisis any time soon .
in essen@@ ce , Europe is satis@@ fied with low growth and borrowing from its gr@@ and@@ children just because that ke@@ ep@@ s the peace and it ke@@ ep@@ s conf@@ used and un@@ decided governments in power just a bit longer .
in fact , not just a bit , they can surely play the same game for another decade .
if Europe &apos;s economy per@@ forms poor@@ ly , blame Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , don &apos;t blame the ECB .
a new central bank and an old economy mean one thing : low inflation and low growth .
the ECB pi@@ cks U@@ p The pace
bu@@ o@@ y@@ ant US economic growth , so far , has provided the European Central Bank with the necessary global back@@ drop to raise interest rates from very low levels at a slow and ste@@ ad@@ y pace that limits political fri@@ ction with euro @-@ zone political leaders but that gets the job done .
that is about to change .
the latest an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al evidence from the US indic@@ ates that the economy is taking a sharp down@@ ward turn , which should become mani@@ fest in the coming months .
unless the ECB pi@@ cks up the pace of interest @-@ rate increases now , the goal of interest @-@ rate ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ lity may not be politically fe@@ a@@ sible , je@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ zing achie@@ vement of the bank &apos;s price stability goals .
the ECB should act with greater al@@ ac@@ ri@@ ty not because there are increased prospects for future growth , but for the opposi@@ te reason : the fear that European growth will slow , thus li@@ mit@@ ing the possibility for future rate hi@@ kes .
indeed , even before the sud@@ den down@@ turn in the US economy , a growing number of members of the ECB &apos;s Govern@@ ing Council already had come to the conclu@@ sion that acceler@@ ating the pace of interest @-@ rate increases was needed if its goal of monetary ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ lity was to be achieved .
the key reason is that several recent &quot; reforms &quot; announced by German Chanc@@ ellor Angela Merkel - raising the value @-@ added tax , increasing us@@ er char@@ ges for he@@ al@@ th@@ care , and tax@@ ing interest payments as a part of so @-@ called corporate tax reform - promise to reduce German economic growth , perhaps significantly , in 2007 .
when Germany s@@ nee@@ zes , Europe cat@@ ches a c@@ old .
as a result , Merkel &apos;s reforms have increased the ang@@ st of euro @-@ zone central bankers that the &quot; win@@ do@@ w of opportunity &quot; for future rate hi@@ kes might be clos@@ ing .
the latest Z@@ E@@ W surv@@ ey of euro @-@ zone business confidence bu@@ t@@ t@@ res@@ ses these fears .
it shows that current conditions are good , but that expectations about future conditions have dro@@ pped off significantly .
the message for the ECB is clear : make ha@@ ste while the su@@ n s@@ hin@@ es .
that is exac@@ tly what the ECB is doing .
ECB President Jean @-@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et indic@@ ated at his July press conference that the bank plans to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on August 3 , not August 3@@ 1 , as expected .
this implies an inter@@ val of two months between interest @-@ rate mo@@ ves instead of the three @-@ month inter@@ val that has become standard ECB practice in the current interest @-@ rate cycle .
the next rate hi@@ ke in the nor@@ mali@@ zation process is expected in October , two months after the expected August move .
ir@@ oni@@ cally , the October meeting of the ECB &apos;s Govern@@ ing Council will take place in Paris this year .
French politicians have been the most aggressive in putting political pressure on the ECB to re@@ la@@ x its interest @-@ rate nor@@ mali@@ zation policy .
French Fin@@ ance Minister T@@ hi@@ err@@ y Bre@@ ton recently war@@ ned the ECB about &quot; n@@ ast@@ y surpri@@ ses . &quot;
prospec@@ tive French presidential candidate Nicol@@ as Sarkozy wants the ECB to promote economic growth , not just price stability .
the Paris meeting af@@ for@@ ds the ECB an opportunity to make a political stat@@ ement - its &quot; Dec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ dependence , &quot; so to spe@@ ak - by raising interest rates on French so@@ il .
T@@ rich@@ et already has c@@ lea@@ red the way for this to happen .
in June , the ECB jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed its long @-@ standing practice of not changing rates outside of Frank@@ fur@@ t , increasing them by 25 basis points in Mad@@ rid .
T@@ rich@@ et is a cle@@ ver and re@@ sourc@@ eful person .
but even he might find it da@@ un@@ ting to reconci@@ le the conflic@@ ting demands of the ECB to acceler@@ ate the interest @-@ rate nor@@ mali@@ zation process and those of the French political establishment to maintain the status quo .
but the recent good economic numbers coming out of France should make an October rate hi@@ ke easier for French politicians to accept .
the ECB is acceler@@ ating the pace of nor@@ mali@@ zation at precisely the right moment .
the danger is that it will be bl@@ am@@ ed if European growth fal@@ ters .
however , with the German and US economies slow@@ ing pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ously , the ECB would have a perf@@ ect co@@ ver for its interest @-@ rate mo@@ ves .
the ECB could convinc@@ ingly argue that Merkel &apos;s reforms and the US , not its interest @-@ rate hi@@ kes , are responsible for the European slowdown , should one occur .
politically , the path is clear for the ECB to act .
the ECB &apos;s B@@ att@@ le against Central Bank@@ ing
Ber@@ kel@@ ey - W@@ hen the European Central Bank announced its program of government @-@ bond purch@@ ases , it let financial markets know that it th@@ or@@ ou@@ ghly dis@@ lik@@ ed the idea , was not fully committed to it , and would re@@ verse the policy as soon as it could .
indeed , the ECB proc@@ la@@ im@@ ed its belief that the stabili@@ zation of government @-@ bond prices brought about by such purch@@ ases would be only temporary .
it is difficult to think of a more self @-@ defe@@ ating way to implement a bond @-@ purch@@ ase program .
by making it clear from the out@@ set that it did not trust its own policy , the ECB practi@@ cally guarante@@ ed its failure .
if it so evi@@ d@@ ently l@@ acked confidence in the very bonds that it was bu@@ ying , why should investors feel any differ@@ ently ?
the ECB continues to believe that financial stability is not part of its core business .
as its out@@ going president , Jean @-@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et , put it , the ECB has &quot; only one ne@@ ed@@ le on &#91; its &#93; comp@@ ass , and that is inflation . &quot; the ECB &apos;s ref@@ us@@ al to be a len@@ der of last res@@ ort forced the creation of a sur@@ ro@@ gate institution , the European Financial St@@ ability F@@ aci@@ lity .
but everyone in the financial markets knows that the E@@ FS@@ F has in@@ sufficient fi@@ re@@ power to under@@ take that task - and that it has an un@@ work@@ able governance structure to boo@@ t .
perhaps the most ast@@ oni@@ shing thing about the ECB &apos;s mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ mati@@ c price @-@ stability mission and ut@@ ter dis@@ regard for financial stability - much less for the welfare of the workers and businesses that make up the economy - is its radical de@@ par@@ ture from the central @-@ banking tradi@@ tion .
modern central banking go@@ t its start in the collapse of the British can@@ al boom of the early 18@@ 20 &quot; s .
during the financial crisis and recession of 18@@ 25 @-@ 18@@ 2@@ 6 , a central bank - the Bank of England - interven@@ ed in the interest of financial stability as the ir@@ rational ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ance of the boom turned into the re@@ mor@@ se@@ ful p@@ essi@@ mism of the bu@@ st .
in his book L@@ om@@ bar@@ d Street , W@@ alter Ba@@ ge@@ ho@@ t quot@@ ed Jer@@ emi@@ ah Har@@ man , the govern@@ or of the Bank of England in the 18@@ 25 @-@ 18@@ 2@@ 6 crisis :
&quot; we l@@ ent ... by every possible means and in mo@@ des we had never adopted before ; we took in stock on security , we purch@@ ased ex@@ ch@@ equ@@ er bil@@ ls , we made adv@@ ances on ex@@ ch@@ equ@@ er bil@@ ls , we not only dis@@ coun@@ ted ou@@ tri@@ ght , but we made adv@@ ances on the deposi@@ t of bil@@ ls of exchange to an immen@@ se amount , in short , by every possible means consist@@ ent with the safety of the Bank , and we were not on some cases over @-@ ni@@ ce .
se@@ eing the d@@ read@@ ful state in which the public were , we ren@@ dered every assistance in our power ... &quot;
the Bank of England &apos;s char@@ ter did not give it the legal authority to under@@ take such len@@ der @-@ of @-@ last @-@ res@@ ort financial @-@ stability operations . but the Bank under@@ took them any@@ way .
half a generation later , Britain &apos;s Parliament deb@@ ated whether the modi@@ fic@@ ations of the Bank &apos;s char@@ ter should give it exp@@ li@@ cit power to conduc@@ t len@@ der @-@ of @-@ last @-@ res@@ ort operations .
the answer was no : gran@@ ting exp@@ li@@ cit power would undermine confidence in price stability , for already there was &quot; difficul@@ ty re@@ stra@@ in &#91; ing &#93; over @-@ issue , de@@ preci@@ ation , and fr@@ au@@ d . &quot; indeed , gran@@ ting exp@@ li@@ cit len@@ der @-@ of @-@ last @-@ res@@ ort powers to the Bank of England would mean that the &quot; mi@@ ll@@ en@@ ni@@ um of the pap@@ er @-@ mon@@ g@@ ers would be at hand . &quot;
but the leaders of Parliament also believed that the absence of a co@@ di@@ fied authority to act as len@@ der of last res@@ ort would not keep the Bank of England from doing so when nec@@ essi@@ ty comm@@ anded .
as Fir@@ st L@@ or@@ d of the Treasury S@@ ir Robert Pe@@ el w@@ ro@@ te : &quot; if it be necessary to assu@@ me a gra@@ ve responsibility , I d@@ are say men will be willing to assu@@ me such a responsibility . &quot;
our current political and economic institutions rest upon the w@@ ager that a de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zed market provides a better social @-@ plann@@ ing , coordin@@ ation , and capital @-@ alloc@@ ation mechanism than any other that we have yet been able to devi@@ se .
but , since the da@@ wn of the Industri@@ al Revolution , part of that system has been a central financial authority that pre@@ ser@@ ves trust that contrac@@ ts will be fulfi@@ lled and promises kept .
time and again , the len@@ der @-@ of @-@ last @-@ res@@ ort role has been an indi@@ sp@@ ens@@ able part of that func@@ tion .
that is what the ECB is now thro@@ wing away .
saving Europe &apos;s Re@@ al he@@ gem@@ on
M@@ uni@@ ch - L@@ ast June , the European Commission announced its about @-@ face on bank restructuring .
the money for rec@@ apit@@ ali@@ zing dist@@ res@@ sed banks would now come prim@@ arily from creditors , not European taxpay@@ ers , with a p@@ ec@@ king order to speci@@ fy which len@@ ders would be re@@ paid first .
all of this is wel@@ come , at least in principle .
in practice , however , the sch@@ eme lea@@ ves much to be desi@@ red .
the problem is that a very long list of exc@@ ep@@ tions redu@@ ces the reco@@ ver@@ able assets to such an extent that in many cases it will still be impossible to make do without public money . the long @-@ term plan is that this money should come from a fund created by European banks themselves .
but the Euro@@ group ( a meeting of eurozone finance ministers atten@@ ded by the European Union &apos;s economic and monetary affairs com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er and the European Central Bank president ) is suggest@@ ing that , until then , the European St@@ ability Mechan@@ ism ( ES@@ M ) - and thus the taxpay@@ ers - will fi@@ ll the gap .
given that taxpay@@ ers are thus supposed to finance guarante@@ es for deposi@@ ts up to € 10@@ 0,000 ( $ 1@@ 3@@ 3@@ ,000 ) - the medi@@ an level of D@@ ut@@ ch household wealth and twi@@ ce the German medi@@ an - the Euro@@ group &apos;s proposal bo@@ ils down to a massive re@@ distribution of wealth in Europe , the di@@ men@@ sions of which are not understood by the public .
the idea of ex@@ emp@@ ting banks &quot; sec@@ ured debt from the p@@ ec@@ king order for re@@ pay@@ ment is extrem@@ ely problemati@@ c as well .
while this proposal may sound harm@@ less and almost self @-@ evi@@ dent , it is not ; sec@@ ured debt needs no further protection , because it is already sec@@ ured .
viewed from this perspective , the additional protection af@@ for@@ ded by the ex@@ emp@@ tion is highly surpri@@ sing .
the ex@@ emp@@ tion for sec@@ ured debt und@@ ou@@ b@@ tedly concerns mainly the re@@ financing loans that the ECB has exten@@ ded to commercial banks against increasingly weak coll@@ ater@@ al .
for the eurozone &apos;s crisis @-@ ri@@ d@@ den economies ( C@@ yp@@ rus , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Portugal , and Spain ) , the combined total is € 7@@ 3@@ 2 billion .
these loans ex@@ tend far beyond providing the liquidity that these countries need for internal cir@@ cul@@ ation , for which a ma@@ xim@@ um of € 3@@ 35 billion - their available stock of central @-@ bank money - would have su@@ f@@ fic@@ ed .
instead , by weak@@ ening safety standards , bail@@ ing out foreign investors , and financing current @-@ account deficits , the ECB has under@@ cut and re@@ placed the private European inter@@ bank market .
with several banks in the crisis countries on the ver@@ ge of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , many of these loans have now turned to@@ xi@@ c .
after all , if one takes the average of estimates repor@@ ted by rep@@ ut@@ able sources , the wri@@ te @-@ off losses of the six crisis countries &quot; banks amount to about € 6@@ 70 billion . particip@@ ating in these wri@@ te @-@ off@@ s would put huge stra@@ in on the Euro@@ system ( the ECB and the central banks of the eurozone member states ) , which has only around € 500 billion in equity capital .
the risk@@ iness of the ECB &apos;s strategy of using the prin@@ ting press to ba@@ il out banks , including their public and private cli@@ ents , would become appar@@ ent to everyone .
thus , it is clear how the losses inc@@ ur@@ red by the ECB &apos;s de facto regional fiscal policy are to be avoi@@ ded : the wri@@ te @-@ off costs will be trans@@ fer@@ red from the ECB to the ES@@ M .
this makes no difference to taxpay@@ ers , who will have to pay for both institutions &quot; losses in the same man@@ ner .
but it has the advantage of allowing the ECB to present itself as having a cle@@ an balance she@@ et , thereby enab@@ ling it to maintain its current policy .
ultimately , this is merely a new round of the eurozone &apos;s old game of financial hi@@ de @-@ and @-@ seek , where@@ by losses are ob@@ s@@ cu@@ red by distribu@@ ting them among different institutions and time h@@ ori@@ z@@ ons . the game started with the bail@@ out fund for Greece , which was followed by the European Financial St@@ ability F@@ aci@@ lity , the European Financial St@@ ability Mechan@@ ism , and the International Monetary Fund , which in turn were re@@ lie@@ ved by the ES@@ M .
in each case , a major objective was to reduce the burden on the ECB , which had advanced the money by prin@@ ting it and would have run into serious difficul@@ ties without help .
the entire arrange@@ ment is highly problemati@@ c from the stand@@ point of democracy , because the ini@@ tial decisions about under@@ cutting the capital markets by means of public credit were taken by the ECB &apos;s Govern@@ ing Council , in which large countries like France or Germany have the same vot@@ ing power as C@@ yp@@ rus or Mal@@ ta .
indeed , the national central banks &quot; alloc@@ ation of emer@@ gency liquidity assistance required appro@@ val by only one @-@ third of the Govern@@ ing Council &apos;s members , and the six crisis countries had these vot@@ es .
according to the Euro@@ group &apos;s proposal , these self @-@ a@@ war@@ ded loans , too , are now to be sec@@ ured by ES@@ M funds .
while the European Union &apos;s national parli@@ am@@ ents must still decide on the sch@@ eme , they essen@@ tially have no option but to ass@@ ent , because to do otherwise would sever@@ ely har@@ m the ECB .
when they finally get to vote on the matter - years after the ECB &apos;s risk@@ y credit man@@ eu@@ vers - they will have no choice but to ba@@ il out the ECB , the true he@@ gem@@ on of the eurozone .
the ECB &apos;s hon@@ e@@ y@@ mo@@ on is O@@ ver
the hon@@ e@@ y@@ mo@@ on for the European Central Bank is over .
because European interest rates no longer are clearly out of wh@@ ack with the fundament@@ als of the euro @-@ zone economy , monetary policy has become more complex .
at the same time , France has given a strong mandate to its new president , Nicol@@ as Sarkozy , who is without question the most formi@@ dable political ad@@ vers@@ ary the ECB has had to face in its b@@ rief history .
Sarkozy stands ready to po@@ un@@ ce on any mistak@@ es the Bank may make in this more difficult policy environment .
with European interest rates up 200 basis points since late 2005 and the euro near a record high , Sarkozy wants the ECB to stop raising rates now .
ECB president Jean @-@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et and the Govern@@ ing Council strong@@ ly dis@@ agree .
at the ECB press conference in early July , T@@ rich@@ et sign@@ aled at least one more rate hi@@ ke - either in September or October .
some Council members are known to support two more rate hi@@ kes before year @-@ end .
what makes monetary policy tri@@ ck@@ y at this point is that the German economy - which has been Europe &apos;s lo@@ com@@ o@@ tive during the current cy@@ cli@@ cal up@@ turn - may be reaching a turning point .
sur@@ ve@@ ys of business and invest@@ or confidence have so@@ f@@ ten@@ ed - the resp@@ ected I@@ f@@ o inde@@ x of German business senti@@ ment fell from 10@@ 7@@ .@@ 0 to 10@@ 6@@ .@@ 4 in J@@ ul@@ y@@ amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; and the so @-@ called &quot; hard data &quot; - industrial production , reta@@ il s@@ ales , et@@ c@@ .@@ amp # 45 ; amp # 45 ; - has been mi@@ xed .
second quarter German GDP has st@@ all@@ ed after a surpri@@ sing@@ ly strong first quarter .
the j@@ ury is out but there is reason to be concerned .
the euro is at record levels , oil prices are sur@@ ging and interest rates are expected to go higher .
the euro @-@ zone economy - including Germany &apos;@@ sam@@ p # 45 ; amp # 45 ; is not bul@@ let@@ pro@@ of though the ha@@ w@@ ks in the Govern@@ ing Council often talk as if it were .
just as last year when there was un@@ war@@ ran@@ ted growth p@@ essi@@ mism in Europe , this year there is un@@ war@@ ran@@ ted growth eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a .
many Ger@@ mans , in particular , are in deni@@ al that the cy@@ cli@@ cal up@@ turn may be coming to an end .
were the Govern@@ ing Council to mis@@ s the coming turn in the European economy while bli@@ th@@ ely raising interest rates , they would be por@@ tra@@ yed as dr@@ un@@ ken sa@@ il@@ ors on a rate @-@ raising bin@@ ge .
the ro@@ ar for greater political control over Europe &apos;s central bank would be de@@ af@@ ening - and not only from France .
the political costs for the ECB of making this type of mistake could be ex@@ or@@ bit@@ ant .
this is why the ECB must be very p@@ ru@@ dent as it consi@@ ders whether to maintain the current pace of rate hi@@ kes , in which case it would raise rates by 25 basis points in September , or slow the pace down a bit , in which case the next rate hi@@ ke would come in October at the ear@@ li@@ est .
in the current political environment , the dang@@ ers to the ECB from outside political inter@@ ference are much greater from raising rates too fast than too slow@@ ly .
if it goes too slow , the ECB has ear@@ ned sufficient credibility as an inflation figh@@ ter to make up for it in the future with little if any economic or political cost .
but if it goes too fast , the political cost could be substantial and ir@@ rever@@ sible .
politicians will push for more control and probably get it , Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty or no Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht treaty .
wa@@ iting until October for the next move up is like bu@@ ying insurance against a c@@ atastrop@@ hi@@ c loss .
but will the ECB see it this way ?
as a matter of principle , the ha@@ w@@ ks ref@@ use to consider the political costs of their actions .
in earlier times with no formi@@ dable ad@@ vers@@ aries in the political ar@@ ena , this was a harm@@ less aff@@ ec@@ tation .
but it is an extrem@@ ely dangerous attitu@@ de with people like Sarkozy ready , willing and able to impose high political costs upon the bank should it st@@ um@@ ble .
there is more interest in Sarkozy &apos;s populist ideas about currency intervention and ad@@ ding a new political di@@ men@@ sion to monetary policy decisions than is com@@ mon@@ ly reali@@ zed .
the ha@@ w@@ ks also suffer from what can be called a &quot; cat@@ ch up &quot; complex .
no matter how high rates go , they think they &apos;@@ re behind .
they want to go in September so that they can go again in December ( even before kno@@ wing the data ) - and they won &apos;t stop there either .
even the do@@ ves might support a rate hi@@ ke in September to counter @-@ act the char@@ ge that they are being bul@@ lied out of a September hi@@ ke by Sarkozy .
there is no doubt that Sarkozy &apos;s attacks on the ECB are having a counter @-@ productive effect in this regard .
they are pres@@ suring the ECB to raise rates so@@ on@@ er than later .
but a September rate move also ser@@ ves Sarkozy &apos;s interests , as it will give him more amm@@ uni@@ tion to por@@ tra@@ y the ECB as out of control and in need of political discipl@@ ining .
for the ECB to protect itself from such char@@ ges , far better to wait until October when the bank can go to the public and say in effect ; &quot; Lo@@ ok , do you see how reasonable we have been .
now we must raise rates . &quot;
in the final analysis , whether the next rate increase comes in September , October or wh@@ en@@ ever - and it looks like September not@@ with@@ standing current war@@ ning signs like I@@ f@@ o that suggest a possible slowdown in the coming mon@@ th@@ sam@@ p # 45 ; amp # 45 ; the data will determine how far the ECB goes with its rate hi@@ kes if the bank is sav@@ v@@ y enough to keep the politicians at ba@@ y .
but this is a big &quot; if . &quot;
the fight is on between the two French ti@@ t@@ ans - T@@ rich@@ et and Sarkozy - with the f@@ ate of Europe &apos;s central bank h@@ ang@@ ing in the balance .
the ECB &apos;s P@@ ath No@@ t taken
it is now clear that the European Central Bank views higher interest rates as the right response to rising oil prices .
as a result , the ECB risks pain@@ ting itself into a cor@@ ner , for the logi@@ c behind this week &apos;s interest @-@ rate hi@@ ke implies that more increases will follow - a seri@@ es of policy mistak@@ es that will cost the Eurozone economies heavily .
despite stat@@ ements to the contrary , no central bank , including the ECB , can simply focus on inflation and ignor@@ e what happen@@ s to economic activity .
sup@@ pose , for the s@@ ake of argument , that stabili@@ zing prices came at the cost of a 30 % unemployment rate .
surely no@@ body would want that .
the ECB &apos;s defen@@ ders would say that such an outcome is pu@@ rely hy@@ po@@ the@@ ti@@ cal - and ir@@ relevant - for there is no conflict between stabili@@ zing inflation and susta@@ ining the appropriate level of economic activity .
price stability , according to this view , redu@@ ces uncertainty , thereby enab@@ ling firms and individuals to take the right decisions , so it is good , not bad , for economic activity .
this argument is true - most of the time .
but when an economy faces a major ad@@ verse sho@@ ck , such as a sharp increase in oil prices , then the t@@ win goals of stabili@@ zing inflation and maintaining economic activity conflict , and the central bank &apos;s job becomes more difficult .
think about what stabili@@ zing inflation means in such a context .
firms are likely to p@@ ass the increase in energy costs on to consumers by raising their prices .
in response , workers are likely to demand higher nomin@@ al wages .
if the central bank is to avoid an inflation spi@@ ral , it must ensure that the &quot; first round &quot; effects of higher energy prices on inflation do not fuel such &quot; second round &quot; effects .
in an environment where productivity gains and wage growth are already weak , as in Europe today , persu@@ ad@@ ing workers to accept a cut in real wages may be t@@ ough .
the interest @-@ rate increase decided this week will soon appear in@@ sufficient , and will have to be followed by further hi@@ kes and a large increase in unemployment .
in order to achieve its inflation goal , the ECB may have to contrac@@ t activity until workers are , in effect , be@@ aten into sub@@ mission .
is there a better way to respond to ad@@ verse sho@@ cks ?
the answer from monetary theory is an un@@ ambi@@ gu@@ ous &quot; yes &quot; : give workers a chance to ad@@ just to higher energy prices , allow for some p@@ ass @-@ through of higher prices to wages over time ( so that wages ad@@ just more gradu@@ ally ) , and make clear that inflation will return to its target range within , say , a year or two .
such a policy will limit the increase in unemployment , at the cost of only tempor@@ arily higher inflation .
so , why is the ECB set on a tou@@ gh@@ er course ?
there are three plau@@ sible reasons .
first , there has been little wage pressure so far .
so the ECB may not have to increase interest rates very much in order to con@@ tain inflation .
if this scenario pla@@ ys out , the impact on economic activity and employment will be minim@@ al .
but there are good historical gro@@ unds for thinking that it won &apos;t .
what we are se@@ eing in Europe today is more likely to be del@@ ay@@ ed adjustment rather than pas@@ sive accept@@ ance of real wage cuts by workers and uni@@ ons .
the ECB should not del@@ u@@ de itself into thinking that a small increase in interest rates will be enough .
if and when wage pressure comes , the ECB , to remain true to its wor@@ d , may be forced to increase interest rates much more than it now expec@@ ts .
the second argument is that if the ECB stands firm , workers will not demand higher nomin@@ al wages , for they will understand that this would only lead to higher interest rates and higher unemployment .
this argument is not ir@@ relevant ; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bar@@ gaining .
but one should not expect too much from a t@@ ough ECB stance .
think of the limited success of the ECB &apos;s advoc@@ acy of greater labor @-@ market flexi@@ bility : there has been no dramatic increase in the pace of reforms .
the third argument is that higher inflation today would en@@ danger the ECB &apos;s credibility in the future .
this argument , too , is hardly ir@@ relevant : higher inflation today must not be per@@ mit@@ ted to change inflation expectations in the medium run .
leaving interest rates on hold in the face of ad@@ verse price sho@@ cks thus requires a convinc@@ ing explan@@ ation by the ECB of its underlying policy .
here , the ECB &apos;s task is all the more difficult because , having focused so nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly on inflation stabili@@ zation , markets would re@@ ad adop@@ tion of a more flexi@@ ble stance as a change in position .
moreover , because the ECB has actually exc@@ ee@@ ded its inflation target in recent years , its credibility is already in doubt .
true , adop@@ ting the appropriate policy would require the ECB to arti@@ cul@@ ate its ration@@ ale with great care .
here it can take lessons from its British and American counter@@ parts : credibility does not require do@@ gmati@@ sm , but rather c@@ lar@@ ity of pur@@ pose .
what is at stak@@ e is too important to ignor@@ e .
on its current policy path , unless oil prices fall , the ECB risks being forced to com@@ mit to substanti@@ ally higher interest rates , and thus to a further increase in Eurozone unemployment .
the ECB &apos;s R@@ is@@ k@@ y B@@ us@@ iness
Brussels - A central bank always has a crucial role to play in a financial crisis .
but the European Central Bank &apos;s role within the eurozone nowadays is even more &quot; central &quot; than that of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England .
a key difference between the eurozone and the United States is that lending between two banks loc@@ ated in two different member countries is still perceived as car@@ r@@ ying quite different risks than &quot; domestic &quot; lending ( between two banks in the same country ) .
this is not the case in the US , because it has an integr@@ ated financial system , and support for banks ( deposi@@ t insurance or ou@@ tri@@ ght bail@@ outs ) is administ@@ ered at the federal level .
as a result , the fact that C@@ aliforni@@ a might be closer to bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy than some eurozone countries has no influence at all on the credit r@@ ating of banks head@@ quar@@ tered there , or on their ability to ob@@ tain funds on the inter@@ bank market .
in Europe , by contrast , the f@@ ate of all banks depends upon their home governments .
during the credit boom before 2007 , enormous cross @-@ border inter@@ bank claims built up , because banks tru@@ sted one another .
then , in 2008 , the inter@@ bank market sud@@ den@@ ly f@@ ro@@ ze as that trust ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated .
this was a gener@@ alized phen@@ om@@ en@@ on , not focused on particular countries , because it was still assum@@ ed at the time that all eurozone governments would be able to ba@@ il out their own banks .
now that the &quot; southern &quot; eurozone governments &quot; solven@@ cy no longer seems assu@@ red , di@@ stru@@ st has grown along national lines .
German banks continue to l@@ end to each other ( and to other banks in nor@@ thern Europe ) , but they are no longer willing to l@@ end to Italian , Sp@@ anish , or other banks in southern Europe .
a sud@@ den withdra@@ w@@ al of inter@@ bank funding has the same consequences as a bank run .
a bank that sud@@ den@@ ly has to re@@ pay its inter@@ bank debt must cut credit to its own cust@@ om@@ ers or sell off other assets , leading to large losses .
this is precisely what happened when the inter@@ bank market f@@ ro@@ ze after L@@ eh@@ man Bro@@ thers collap@@ sed in 2008 .
when the cross @-@ border inter@@ bank market stopp@@ ed working this summer , a similar economic collapse was avoi@@ ded only because the ECB , without much fan@@ fare , became the eurozone &apos;s central cle@@ aring house .
German and other nor@@ thern European banks that no longer trust their southern counter@@ parts par@@ ked their funds at the ECB &apos;s deposi@@ t faci@@ lity , whereas southern European banks used the ECB &apos;s lending faci@@ lities to make up for the loss of private inter@@ bank funding .
regional imbalances in inter@@ bank funding can , of course , also ari@@ se in the US Federal Reserve System .
but they are mostly inter@@ medi@@ ated within nation@@ wide financial institutions .
for example , high @-@ te@@ ch firms in C@@ aliforni@@ a might deposi@@ t cash sur@@ pl@@ uses with local bran@@ ches of a large bank oper@@ ating throughout the US , which might then choose to l@@ end to oil companies in T@@ ex@@ as .
adjustment to sho@@ cks is also independent of loc@@ ation in the US .
if the price of oil falls , oil companies become less credi@@ t@@ wor@@ thy and receive less credit - not because they are in T@@ ex@@ as , but because they are oil companies .
in the eurozone , however , banking is still pre@@ domin@@ antly concent@@ r@@ ated along national lines .
a savings surplus in Germany is rec@@ y@@ c@@ led to Spain mainly through inter@@ bank lending ( German to Sp@@ anish banks ) .
moreover , although the EU is supposed to have an integr@@ ated banking market , the few existing cross @-@ border banking groups are not even allowed to operate as integr@@ ated international banks , because national regulators and super@@ vis@@ ors are &quot; ring @-@ f@@ en@@ cing &quot; the liquidity and assets of foreign banks &quot; local subsi@@ di@@ aries .
for example , an international banking group head@@ quar@@ tered in Italy was recently bar@@ red by super@@ vis@@ ors from using the cash surplus of its subsi@@ di@@ ary in nor@@ thern Europe to fund the group &apos;s operations elsewhere .
that would have been impossible in the US , given that the super@@ vis@@ ors are federal .
moreover , the Federal Reserve System &apos;s regional organization is based on n@@ ine di@@ stric@@ ts , each of which en@@ comp@@ asses several states .
pay@@ ment imbalances between Federal Reserve di@@ stric@@ ts thus cannot represent imbalances between states .
a further difference between the eurozone and the US is that the Federal Reserve norm@@ ally len@@ ds only against public debt , and accep@@ ts only federal debt ( T @-@ bil@@ ls ) as coll@@ ater@@ al .
banks thus cannot use any hol@@ dings of C@@ aliforni@@ a or T@@ ex@@ as state debt to ob@@ tain central @-@ bank funds .
the ECB , on the other hand , accep@@ ts private assets and , in the absence of federal debt , national debt as coll@@ ater@@ al .
this pu@@ ts the ECB in a very different position from the Fed , because the quality of its coll@@ ater@@ al is determined along national lines .
for example , Greek banks have received more than € 100 billion in ECB financing , which is sec@@ ured by a mi@@ x of private Greek assets and Greek government debt .
if the Greek people decide in a referendum to default , the ECB will inc@@ ur large losses , as much of its coll@@ ater@@ al would become wor@@ th@@ less and the Greek banking system would collapse .
the im@@ perf@@ ect integration of Europe &apos;s financial markets and super@@ vis@@ ory structure thus risks over@@ bur@@ den@@ ing the ECB , which has had to become the central counter@@ party for cross @-@ border lending .
but in this func@@ tion it has accumul@@ ated large risks , concent@@ r@@ ated along national lines , thus leading to conflicts among member states .
a common money and a common monetary policy cannot work proper@@ ly with a banking system that is se@@ g@@ ment@@ ed along national lines .
the most urg@@ ent step to stabili@@ ze the euro is not to follow the ch@@ im@@ era of &quot; euro economic government , &quot; but to create the under@@ p@@ inn@@ ings of a truly integr@@ ated banking market with a common super@@ vis@@ or , a form of &quot; federal &quot; deposi@@ t insurance , and a &quot; euro bank res@@ c@@ ue fund &quot; for the large cross @-@ border institutions .
the ECB &apos;s t@@ one @-@ De@@ a@@ f President
Pal@@ o A@@ L@@ TO - O@@ n@@ ce upon a time , European Central Bank President Jean @-@ C@@ lau@@ de T@@ rich@@ et communic@@ ated effectively with the outside world .
not any@@ more .
more than a few e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws were raised after the ECB &apos;s January Govern@@ ing Council meeting , when T@@ rich@@ et threat@@ ened that the Bank would act &quot; pre@@ emp@@ tively &quot; if labor uni@@ ons tried to em@@ bed higher energy and food prices into new contrac@@ ts , risk@@ ing a wage @-@ price spi@@ ral .
this threat took a heavy tol@@ l on the ECB &apos;s credibility , since an interest @-@ rate hi@@ ke in the mi@@ d@@ st of the most serious financial crisis in decades was ob@@ viously ab@@ sur@@ d .
no one believed it , and the ECB not only with@@ dre@@ w its cl@@ ums@@ y threat the next month , but it adopted a policy of interest @-@ rate ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ lity .
but the announ@@ cement of this policy change at the Febru@@ ary meeting also did not go smo@@ o@@ th@@ ly .
T@@ rich@@ et som@@ eh@@ ow gar@@ b@@ led the Council &apos;s message in his press conference , making it sound as if the ECB wanted to shift to an easing bi@@ as instead of &quot; wait and see &quot; ne@@ ut@@ ra@@ lity .
European fi@@ xed @-@ income markets r@@ al@@ lied strong@@ ly as a result , only to re@@ verse course days later when T@@ rich@@ et and his colle@@ ag@@ ues made it clear that the markets had &quot; mis@@ re@@ ad &quot; him .
so there was un@@ wel@@ come and un@@ needed market volati@@ lity because T@@ rich@@ et cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t get the message out stra@@ i@@ ght .
indic@@ ations that T@@ rich@@ et &apos;s communic@@ ative skills were s@@ lipp@@ ing already had become evi@@ dent last September , when the Govern@@ ing Council could not follow through with the rate increase the ECB president had promised the previous month .
for some un@@ known reason , T@@ rich@@ et is ke@@ en not to surprise markets over the very short term .
he ti@@ ps them off about what he plans to do one month in advance , using co@@ de words like &quot; vi@@ gi@@ l@@ ance &quot; to sign@@ al policy change , all the while maintaining with a stra@@ i@@ ght face that the bank never &quot; pre @-@ com@@ mi@@ ts &quot; its policy stance .
many on the Govern@@ ing Council ob@@ ject to this chil@@ dis@@ h game of co@@ de words , because it elimin@@ ates their freedom of action once the Council com@@ mi@@ ts itself to a course of action .
the Council may then be forced to choose between doing the right thing and pre@@ ser@@ ving the credibility of the ECB &apos;s communic@@ ations .
this is precisely what happened in September , when the financial crisis made it impossible for the ECB to proc@@ eed with the interest @-@ rate hi@@ ke that it had &quot; announced &quot; in August .
co@@ de wor@@ d communic@@ ations , which only work in a stable and crisis @-@ free economic and financial environment , had dam@@ aged ECB credibility .
cal@@ m economic wat@@ ers had given the ECB and T@@ rich@@ et a hon@@ e@@ y@@ mo@@ on until last fall .
but , with financial markets now in tur@@ mo@@ il and likely to sta@@ y that way , the time has come for the ECB to jet@@ ti@@ son its use of co@@ de words - a poor sub@@ stitu@@ te for real central bank transparency in any case .
what also needs to be jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed from the ECB &apos;s communic@@ ations policy is its ob@@ s@@ ession with the short run .
with the United States now in recession ( and the possibility of a deep recession not that remo@@ te ) , it is stri@@ king how positive ECB officials sound about the European economy : Europe &apos;s &quot; economic fundament@@ als are sound , &quot; the economy is &quot; robu@@ st , &quot; economic performance is &quot; just below potential , &quot; and so on .
the ECB &apos;s policymakers are not blin@@ d , merely short@@ si@@ gh@@ ted .
they fear that hon@@ est@@ y about Europe &apos;s economic prospects over the next year or so might cause markets to force it into an un@@ wanted rate cut now .
so they ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate and tell st@@ ories about how the European economy is fundament@@ ally different from the US economy .
this is a major mistake , for which the ECB could pay de@@ arly .
yes , today the European economy is not doing b@@ adly .
but how long is this likely to last with the US falling into a deep sl@@ um@@ p ?
the ECB should be pre@@ par@@ ing Europeans for what many of its own officials ad@@ mit in private : Europe has not &quot; de @-@ cou@@ pl@@ ed &quot; from the US .
on the contrary , America &apos;s current economic difficul@@ ties will hit Europe hard , but with a time lag - the best gu@@ ess being 2009 .
this is not to argue , of course , that the ECB should cut interest rates now .
on the contrary , the Bank &apos;s current policy of fighting in@@ flationary pres@@ sures by s@@ lower growth , a stronger euro , and the credit cr@@ un@@ ch seems just about right for the time being .
but , after all the happ@@ y talk about the European economy , how much credibility will the ECB have if Europe eventually succ@@ um@@ bs to rec@@ ession@@ ary pres@@ sures from abroad ?
the ECB &apos;s independence is still a con@@ ten@@ tious political issue in Europe .
it is more p@@ ru@@ dent that it vo@@ ice concern for Europe &apos;s future economic prospects today than face a dec@@ ei@@ ved and an@@ gr@@ y public tom@@ or@@ row .
the ECB &apos;s T@@ wo p@@ ill@@ ars - A Su@@ cc@@ ess
in October 1998 , just before the start of the European Monetary Union , the Govern@@ ing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) adopted a stability ori@@ ented monetary policy strategy .
this strategy com@@ pri@@ ses three el@@ ements : first and fore@@ most it con@@ ta@@ ins a clear commitment to the primary goal of the ECB , which is to saf@@ e@@ gu@@ ard price stability . price stability was defined as an annual increase in the price level of below two perc@@ ent over the medium term .
the other two el@@ ements , which soon became fam@@ ous under the head@@ line of &quot; two p@@ ill@@ ars , &quot; serve as a means to ass@@ ess the risks to the goal of price stability .
the monetary analysis p@@ il@@ lar com@@ pri@@ ses all information coming from various monetary and credit aggre@@ g@@ ates and ser@@ ves to fig@@ ure out the risks to price stability over the medi@@ um@@ - to long @-@ run .
the economic analysis p@@ il@@ lar is based on a wide set of domestic and international economic indic@@ ators from the real and financial sectors ( wages , im@@ port prices , interest and exchange rates et@@ c . ) .
it provides a basis for the assess@@ ment of short@@ - to medium @-@ term price developments .
this two p@@ il@@ lar approach constitu@@ tes a framework for cross @-@ ch@@ ec@@ king indic@@ ations from the shor@@ ter @-@ term economic analysis with those from the longer @-@ term monetary analysis in order to ob@@ tain a robu@@ st view about the risks to price stability .
in the standard model of the ne@@ o @-@ Ke@@ yne@@ sian approach , which has become more and more &quot; state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , &quot; the us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness of money to monetary policy analysis is challeng@@ ed ; there is no need for monetary cross @-@ ch@@ ec@@ king , monetary analysis has no value @-@ added and is super@@ flu@@ ous .
I am not convinc@@ ed by these argum@@ ents .
cust@@ om@@ ary inflation forec@@ a@@ sts and economic analysis alone are not a sufficient basis for monetary policy decisions .
while such decisions must not ignor@@ e longer @-@ term developments , the time h@@ ori@@ z@@ on for inflation forec@@ a@@ sts is usually only one to two years , beyond it gets highly un@@ certain .
moreover , while monetary policy has always to be conduc@@ ted under uncertainty , the ECB was confron@@ ted with a situation of extreme uncertainty .
there was uncertainty concern@@ ing the state of the economy .
the data situation around the start was very uns@@ atis@@ fac@@ tory .
un@@ ob@@ serv@@ able indic@@ ators like the output gap , which pla@@ ys e@@ .@@ g@@ . a central role in ne@@ o @-@ Ke@@ yne@@ sian re@@ commen@@ d@@ ations for monetary policy , are generally known to be very difficult to estim@@ ate in real time .
estimates for the output gap of the euro area at that time were especially doub@@ t@@ ful with data coming from different international institutions v@@ ar@@ ying widely , and being revi@@ sed substanti@@ ally at later st@@ ages .
nor was it clear which models provide the most reasonable account of the func@@ tioning of the economy , especially in a case where more or less he@@ ter@@ o@@ gene@@ ous countries were to form a monetary union .
this was com@@ po@@ und@@ ed by strategic uncertainty related to how markets , investors and consumers would re@@ act to the re@@ plac@@ ement of national currencies with the Euro .
in this highly un@@ certain environment , monetary policy decisions which did not rely on a soli@@ d framework could have been mis@@ gui@@ ded .
this posed a risk of substantial policy err@@ ors , which would have constitu@@ ted a de@@ adly b@@ low on rep@@ ut@@ ation , the most important capital of any central bank .
thus the ECB needed to rely on the few robu@@ st results theory and experience can provide .
the long @-@ run connec@@ tion between money and price developments is among the most robu@@ st economic relation@@ ships . &quot; inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phen@@ om@@ en@@ on . &quot;
this stat@@ ement by the late Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate Mil@@ ton Frie@@ d@@ man has never lost its v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty .
and who would den@@ y that monetary policy has to do with money ? certainly , monetary analysis is no easy task , though this is true for all relevant economic explan@@ ations .
no question , the ne@@ o @-@ Ke@@ yne@@ sian approach is us@@ eful for a central bank &apos;s policy analysis .
but including monetary analysis in a monetary policy strategy is vital to the central bank &apos;s decision making process .
it would be str@@ ange to suggest that any central bank could ignor@@ e the information from money .
many studies have also shown that there is hardly any major asset price inflation ep@@ i@@ so@@ de which was not ac@@ compani@@ ed if not prec@@ e@@ ded by strong growth of money and / or credit .
the question is not whether or not to include monetary analysis in the monetary policy strategy , but how to reconci@@ le the results from the monetary and the economic analy@@ ses to achieve a comprehensive and consist@@ ent assess@@ ment of the risks to price stability .
in the strategy of the ECB this is the role of cro@@ s@@ sch@@ ec@@ king .
it is not surpri@@ sing that in a world of low inflation central banks as well as academi@@ cs have lost interest in &quot; money . &quot;
one can only hope that the world does not have to go through the same process of pa@@ th@@ ological lear@@ ning via high inflation which followed the neg@@ lec@@ t of money during the fif@@ ties and si@@ x@@ ties of the last century .
after all , is it not pre@@ mat@@ ure - if not pla@@ in@@ ly ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t@@ - to claim that all this evidence collec@@ ted over many cent@@ uries and across num@@ erous countries has lost any mean@@ ing for the present and the future ?
can models without an exp@@ li@@ cit , well developed financial sector be expected to explain an economic world in which financial markets play an ever @-@ increasing role ?
how could central banks , which depend on these financial markets to serve as the trans@@ mission mechanism of monetary policy , possibly rely on such models ?
the ECB has never claim@@ ed that its strategy is the ultim@@ ate solution to the challenges monetary policy is confron@@ ted with .
but , it has recogni@@ sed the need to include monetary analysis - in a very broad sense - into its policy consider@@ ations .
and the strategy was flexi@@ ble enough to integr@@ ate the bro@@ a@@ den@@ ing and deep@@ ening of both the monetary and economic analysis .
the two p@@ il@@ lar strategy respon@@ ds to the fact that we ( still ) lack a model which en@@ comp@@ asses both di@@ men@@ sions , the economic or real and the monetary , in a consist@@ ent and robu@@ st man@@ ner .
as long as such a &quot; one @-@ p@@ il@@ lar @-@ approach &quot; is un@@ available , there is no convinc@@ ing reason why the ECB should change a strategy which has served it well and allowed it to establish a remark@@ able tra@@ ck record .
the G@@ M Re@@ ac@@ tion@@ aries
Pal@@ o A@@ L@@ TO - Pe@@ ople everywhere are increasingly vulnerable to the use of what Nobel Pri@@ ze @-@ winn@@ ing chemi@@ st Ir@@ ving L@@ ang@@ mu@@ ir du@@ b@@ bed &quot; pa@@ th@@ ological science &quot; - the &quot; science of things that aren &apos;t so &quot; - to justi@@ fy government regulation or other policies .
it is a speci@@ al@@ ty of self @-@ st@@ y@@ led public @-@ interest groups , whose agenda is often not to protect public health or the environment , but rather to op@@ pose the research , products , or technology that they happen to dis@@ like .
for example , modern techni@@ qu@@ es of gene@@ tic engine@@ ering - also known as bi@@ ot@@ ech@@ nology , re@@ combin@@ ant D@@ NA technology , or gene@@ tic modi@@ fication ( G@@ M ) - provide the tools to make old pl@@ ants do spec@@ tac@@ ular new things .
yet these tools are rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ly mis@@ repres@@ ented to the public .
more than 17 million farmers in roughly three do@@ zen countries worldwide are using G@@ M cro@@ p v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties to produce higher yi@@ elds with fewer in@@ pu@@ ts and lower environmental impact . most of these new v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties are designed to re@@ sist cro@@ p @-@ ra@@ v@@ aging p@@ ests and diseases , so that farmers can adopt environ@@ ment@@ ally fri@@ end@@ lier no @-@ ti@@ ll practices and use more ben@@ ig@@ n her@@ bi@@ ci@@ des .
critics of G@@ M products in@@ sist that they are un@@ te@@ sted , uns@@ af@@ e , un@@ regul@@ ated , un@@ necessary , and un@@ wanted .
but the fac@@ ts show otherwise .
for star@@ ters , there is a broad and long@@ standing consensus among scientists that re@@ combin@@ ant D@@ NA techni@@ qu@@ es are essen@@ tially an exten@@ sion , or re@@ fin@@ ement , of earlier meth@@ ods for gene@@ tic modi@@ fication , and that gene transfer using these preci@@ se , predic@@ table m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular techni@@ qu@@ es does not present any risk per se .
after the cul@@ tiv@@ ation of more than a billion h@@ ec@@ ta@@ res of G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s worldwide - and the consumption in North America alone of more than two trillion serv@@ ings of fo@@ ods that con@@ tain G@@ M ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents - not a single case of in@@ j@@ ury to a person or dis@@ ruption of an ec@@ o@@ system has been do@@ cum@@ ented .
meanwhile , the benefits of G@@ M @-@ cro@@ p cul@@ tiv@@ ation include higher yi@@ elds , lower use of chemi@@ cal p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des , and bi@@ of@@ u@@ el production .
far from being under @-@ regul@@ ated , G@@ M pl@@ ants ( and other organis@@ ms ) have been sub@@ jected to expensive , discrimin@@ atory , and uns@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic over @-@ regulation that has limited the commercial success of ma@@ i@@ ze , cot@@ ton , can@@ ol@@ a , so@@ y@@ be@@ ans , and pap@@ aya , among other c@@ rop@@ s .
in fact , opponents often ass@@ ert that commercial cul@@ tiv@@ ation of G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s has been a dis@@ appoin@@ tment , because it has offered little direct benefit to consumers .
but many advanta@@ ges have already been reali@@ zed .
and G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s currently in development will deliver even more direct and easily identi@@ fi@@ able consumer benefits .
consider , for example , that , because G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s require less chemi@@ cal p@@ esti@@ cide , fewer farmers and their families risk being po@@ is@@ oned by run@@ off into w@@ ater@@ ways and ground water .
from 199@@ 6 to -@@ 2009 , the amount of p@@ esti@@ cide that was spra@@ yed on c@@ rop@@ s worldwide fell by 3@@ 9@@ 3 million ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms - 1.@@ 4 times the total amount of p@@ esti@@ cide app@@ lied annually to c@@ rop@@ s in the European Union .
fur@@ ther@@ more , lower levels of my@@ cot@@ o@@ x@@ ins in p@@ est @-@ resist@@ ant cor@@ n mean fewer bir@@ th def@@ ects , such as sp@@ ina bi@@ fi@@ da , and less to@@ xi@@ city to li@@ v@@ est@@ o@@ ck .
such st@@ ap@@ le food c@@ rop@@ s also can be modi@@ fied to con@@ tain additional nut@@ ri@@ ents .
no @-@ ti@@ ll farm@@ ing techni@@ qu@@ es , in which the so@@ il is not p@@ low@@ ed , mean less so@@ il ero@@ sion , less run@@ off of agricultural chemi@@ c@@ als , and lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions by me@@ ch@@ ani@@ zed f@@ arm equi@@ p@@ ment .
from 199@@ 6 to 2009 , the shift to bi@@ ot@@ ech c@@ rop@@ s reduced carbon emissions by 17@@ .@@ 6 billion ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms , the equivalent of remo@@ ving 7@@ .@@ 8 million c@@ ars from the road for a year .
G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s also have significant economic benefits .
higher yi@@ elds and lower production costs have reduced global commodity prices ( cor@@ n , so@@ y@@ be@@ ans , and deri@@ v@@ atives ) , resulting in higher f@@ arm income , enh@@ anced supp@@ lies of food and fe@@ ed products , and more re@@ adi@@ ly available high @-@ quality cal@@ ories .
indeed , f@@ arm income gre@@ w by nearly $ 65 million from 199@@ 6 to 2009 , as bi@@ ot@@ ech c@@ rop@@ s increased global cor@@ n and so@@ y@@ be@@ an production by 1@@ 30 million and 8@@ 3 million t@@ ons , resp@@ ec@@ tively , owing to higher yi@@ elds and , in Argentina , second cro@@ pp@@ ing of so@@ y@@ be@@ ans .
as a result , by 2007 , global cor@@ n and so@@ y@@ be@@ an prices were nearly 6 % and 10 % lower , resp@@ ec@@ tively , than they would have been had farmers not embra@@ ced these c@@ rop@@ s .
given their benefits , G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s &quot; &quot; repe@@ at inde@@ x &quot; - the propor@@ tion of farmers who , after trying a G@@ M vari@@ ety , choose to plant it again - is very high .
the boost to f@@ arm incomes and f@@ arm security - which trans@@ l@@ ates into higher household incomes and improved standards of living - is particularly important in developing countries , where income levels are low@@ est but per @-@ h@@ ec@@ t@@ are benefits from plan@@ ting G@@ M v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties have been greatest .
but G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s do not benefit only those who grow and consu@@ me them .
according to a 2010 study , fi@@ elds of in@@ sec@@ t @-@ resist@@ ant G@@ M cor@@ n have an &quot; area @-@ wide sup@@ pression effect &quot; on in@@ sec@@ ts , benef@@ iting neighbor@@ ing fi@@ elds con@@ taining conventional cor@@ n v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties .
the rese@@ arch@@ ers calcul@@ ated that , from 199@@ 6 to 2010 , cul@@ tiv@@ ating G@@ M v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties increased farmers &quot; profits in three US states by roughly $ 3.@@ 2 billion - $ 2.@@ 4 billion of which acc@@ ru@@ ed to farmers whose ne@@ ar@@ by fi@@ elds had not been plan@@ ted with G@@ M v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties .
the farmers plan@@ ting the conventional v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties benefit dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately , because they do not have to buy the more expensive G@@ M se@@ e@@ ds .
future gener@@ ations of G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s will bring even more benefits - but only if they are allowed to fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h .
to that end , consumers must understand that G@@ M c@@ rop@@ s hold great potential , while posing neg@@ ligi@@ ble risks , and governments must adopt regulatory policies that face fac@@ ts and re@@ ject pa@@ th@@ ological science .
the Economic Con@@ sequ@@ ences of America &apos;s E@@ lec@@ tions
St@@ an@@ ford - November &apos;s mid @-@ term elections were a sharp re@@ bu@@ ke to the vast expansion of government spending , deficits , and debt in the United States .
elected in the mi@@ d@@ st of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 , President Barack Obama and the Democratic leadership of Congress seemed surpri@@ sed when the public re@@ jected their stimulus , health @-@ care reform , and energy policies by large mar@@ g@@ ins .
of course , some of the huge increase in expendi@@ ture and debt has been the result of the recession , and of the defense and other spending leg@@ aci@@ es of President George W. Bush .
but , instead of fin@@ ding security and sal@@ v@@ ation from recession in a new era of dependence on government , most voters were rep@@ ell@@ ed by such policies &quot; appar@@ ent failure to do much to improve the economy .
thus , the election results should not be viewed prim@@ arily as an end@@ or@@ s@@ ement of the Republi@@ cans , but as a re@@ bu@@ ke to the Democrats &quot; agenda , which voters believed was out of tou@@ ch with their concerns , interests , and values .
the Republi@@ cans took control of the House of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives , net@@ ting more than 60 se@@ ats - the most in over 70 years - and six Sen@@ ate se@@ ats .
they gained in every part of the country , but especially in the industrial he@@ ar@@ t@@ land from Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania to Wis@@ consi@@ n .
they also won many govern@@ or@@ ships and took over many state legi@@ s@@ lat@@ ures ; both will play a vital role in re@@ dra@@ wing Con@@ gres@@ sional and legisl@@ ative di@@ stric@@ ts in the re@@ ap@@ por@@ tion@@ ment next year following the 2010 cen@@ sus .
with divided government , many expect parti@@ s@@ an gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck on major legislation . but there is reason to be hop@@ eful : the American economy , labor market , and stock market have histori@@ cally fa@@ red a bit better in years of divided government .
moreover , the changed Con@@ gres@@ sional land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e will be better for trade @-@ related legislation .
the Republi@@ cans &quot; protection@@ ist wing is smaller than the Democrats , &quot; which may eventually help free @-@ trade agreements between the US and countries such as South Korea and Col@@ om@@ bia , as well as a revi@@ val of the mor@@ i@@ b@@ und D@@ oh@@ a round of global trade @-@ liberalization talks .
likewise , economic ( but not other ) tensions between China and the US should be a little easier to manage .
&quot; global re@@ bal@@ ancing &quot; requires surplus countries such as China to boost consumption , while deficit countries such as the US save more ( which requires sharply lower budget deficits and increased private saving ) . it will get a more sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic he@@ aring from the new Congress than from President Obama , who was so@@ und@@ ly re@@ bu@@ ked at the Sec@@ ond G @-@ 20 Sum@@ mit for dem@@ anding more deficit @-@ finan@@ ced spending .
the new Congress will not support Obama &apos;s additional stimulus plans , such as a national infrastructure bank .
Republi@@ cans will want to reform federal infrastructure spending - which is already substantial - rather than add to it .
they are committed to ro@@ lling back spending to 2008 levels .
in short , they want to ensure that the spending explo@@ sion is indeed temporary , not ent@@ ren@@ ched in a new bas@@ el@@ ine for the federal budget .
but Obama &apos;s ve@@ to power is a big obstac@@ le to re@@ vers@@ ing his policies .
while Republi@@ cans will be able to make some in@@ ro@@ ads on reducing spending and prev@@ enting tax hi@@ kes , making good on their vo@@ w to &quot; repe@@ al and re@@ place &quot; Obama &apos;s sig@@ nature health @-@ care reform would require a Republican to be elected as president in 2012 .
a sho@@ w@@ down also lo@@ oms over tax policy .
Obama &apos;s temporary first @-@ year expen@@ sing proposal for capital purch@@ ases ( a good idea as part of a permanent corporate @-@ tax over@@ hau@@ l ) could get fol@@ ded into broader tax legislation .
but the center of attention will be the exp@@ iring Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , which reduced margin@@ al tax rates on income , divi@@ den@@ ds , and capital gains .
Obama wants to let the cuts exp@@ ire at the end of this year , but only for those with incomes over $ 2@@ 5@@ 0,000 .
Republi@@ cans will moun@@ t substantial pressure to ex@@ tend the tax cuts for all , as well as to prevent expansion of the so @-@ called alternative minim@@ um tax ( which app@@ lies if it is larger than the regul@@ ar tax ) from h@@ it@@ ting millions more taxpay@@ ers . indeed , the lower margin@@ al rate ought to be made permanent , but ac@@ compani@@ ed by spending control , with broader tax reform to come later .
another important feat@@ ure of the new Congress will be hei@@ ghten@@ ed pol@@ ari@@ zation .
the center of gra@@ v@@ ity of the rema@@ ining Democrats has mo@@ ved to the left , because the vast majority of defe@@ ated Democrats were moder@@ ates from s@@ wing di@@ stric@@ ts .
likewise , the Republi@@ cans elected several conservative sen@@ ators and a si@@ ze@@ able number of more conservative House members .
this will make compromise even more difficult , as will parti@@ s@@ an posi@@ tioning in the run @-@ up to the 2012 presidential election .
meanwhile , most political analy@@ sts do not expect Obama to make as large a move to the political center as President Bill Clinton did when the Republi@@ cans took control of Congress after the 1994 mid @-@ term elections .
Clinton then worked with Republi@@ cans to balance the budget and reform welfare , easily winn@@ ing re @-@ election in 199@@ 6 .
but Obama star@@ ts much further left than Clinton , making a move to the middle a longer tre@@ k if he deci@@ des to em@@ bar@@ k on it .
that means that a period of legisl@@ ative stal@@ em@@ ate lo@@ oms over many of the big issues .
we are likely to see some spending consolid@@ ation , but less than in Great Britain and other European countries .
temporary exten@@ sion of most or all of the Bush @-@ era tax cuts is also likely .
and trade liberalization may be an area where Obama and Congress can agree .
in@@ action in other areas will be bad news for many .
but America &apos;s l@@ ur@@ ch toward a European @-@ style social @-@ welfare state in Obama &apos;s first two years appears to have been hal@@ ted , if not perman@@ ently ended or rever@@ sed .
and that is good news for the US - and for the global economy .
the Economic Con@@ sequ@@ ences of S@@ il@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi
Mil@@ an - S@@ il@@ vi@@ o Berlusconi has survi@@ ved a confidence vote , but his government is virtually de@@ ad .
one cannot rule a country with so sc@@ ant a majority .
not for long . &amp; # 160 ;
the one important decision that this , Berlusconi &apos;s fo@@ ur@@ th government , ever bo@@ ther@@ ed to take was a decision not to decide .
two years ago , when financial crisis sho@@ ok the world , Berlusconi &apos;s choice was to avoid any policy intervention to counter@@ act the Great Rec@@ ession .
this contribu@@ ted to the deep@@ est fall in output in Italy &apos;s post@@ war history , with a cum@@ ul@@ ative 6@@ .@@ 5 % decline in GDP .
within the G @-@ 20 , only Japan did worse .
remark@@ ably , Italy had twi@@ ce the fall in output seen in France , another large OECD country that , like Italy , had avoi@@ ded the ro@@ ot causes of the crisis : a housing boom @-@ bu@@ st sequ@@ ence and a serious bank crisis .
the parado@@ x is that the Berlusconi government &apos;s in@@ action did prevent a major de@@ teri@@ or@@ ation in the public deficit .
in light of the current debt crisis ro@@ il@@ ing the eurozone , the advanta@@ ges of a policy of in@@ er@@ ti@@ a are easy to appreci@@ ate .
Italy &apos;s position today could have been much worse than it is .
the Italian economy &apos;s problems , and the major issues concern@@ ing the sustain@@ ability of the country &apos;s huge public debt , are ro@@ ot@@ ed in low growth of potential output .
as is also reve@@ aled by the term structure of credit @-@ default s@@ w@@ aps for Italian debt , investors are not wor@@ ried about , say , the 2011 budget law .
instead , they are wor@@ ried about Italy &apos;s economic conditions in 5 @-@ 10 years .
it is these medium @-@ run problems that Berlusconi &apos;s government has over@@ loo@@ ked .
none of the structural reforms essential to improving Italy &apos;s growth potential - for example , labor @-@ market and unemployment benefit reforms , product market liber@@ ali@@ zations , impro@@ vements of the education system , reforms of the public administration in the South &amp; # 160 ; - &amp; # 160 ; has been car@@ ried out , even though Berlusconi could coun@@ t on soli@@ d maj@@ orities in both ch@@ am@@ bers of Parliament .
why did Berlusconi &apos;s government choose such a pas@@ sive economic policy ?
one reason is that the level of Italian debt did not leave much room for counter@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal fiscal policy .
but some effort to stimul@@ ate the economy at the out@@ set of the crisis could have been attemp@@ ted .
for inst@@ ance , it would have been possible to provide income support to job los@@ ers - which would have been us@@ eful after the crisis as well - by re@@ forming the system of unemployment benefits .
a possible explan@@ ation for the government &apos;s in@@ action over the past two and half years is that the measures agreed upon within the coalition that won the 2008 elections were not ta@@ i@@ lo@@ red to a country enter@@ ing a major recession .
there was no leadership over economic policy defin@@ ing new pri@@ orities and measures to meet the changed macroeconomic conditions .
in its first month after coming to power , the government did actually try to do something for the economy .
it took three decisions , all of which were soon reve@@ aled to be ut@@ ter@@ ly wrong .
the first decision was to reduce taxes on over@@ time work , a measure clearly aimed at increasing the number of hours worked .
ne@@ ed@@ less to say , as unemployment ro@@ se and many other countries de@@ cre@@ ased hours worked in order to con@@ tain job losses , tax reduc@@ tions on over@@ time were ph@@ ased out and the sco@@ pe of short @-@ time work was enh@@ anced .
a similar f@@ ate occurred to a R@@ ob@@ in Ho@@ od tax , which , according to Fin@@ ance Minister Gi@@ uli@@ o Tre@@ mon@@ ti , should have forced banks and oil produc@@ ers to provide resources for the poor .
the tax on banks had to be trans@@ formed into a commitment to provide f@@ res@@ h money to tro@@ ub@@ led financial institutions via the so @-@ called &quot; Tre@@ mon@@ ti B@@ onds . &quot;
and the increase in the tax on oil produc@@ ers , implemented when the oil price stood at $ 160 per bar@@ re@@ l , had to be post@@ pon@@ ed when the price per bar@@ re@@ l fell to $ 30 .
the last measure taken was the dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling of the real @-@ estate tax , a major source of revenue for local governments .
this tax has not yet been re@@ sto@@ red , but the government is plann@@ ing to intro@@ du@@ ce a number of new le@@ vi@@ es on housing , which would ultimately restore the lost revenues .
in this way , Italy lost 30 months without en@@ ac@@ ting the structural reforms that it so b@@ adly needs to restore the country &apos;s growth potential .
true , such reforms are particularly difficult during bad times , but a large number of them have been car@@ ried in the European Union precisely during rec@@ essions .
the fact of the matter is that down@@ turns are times of &quot; extra@@ ordinary politics , &quot; in which it is possible to create larger co@@ ali@@ tions for far @-@ r@@ ang@@ ing economic @-@ policy changes .
a government pursu@@ ing a reform agenda should , under these circumstances , make the public aw@@ are of the emer@@ gency conditions and appe@@ al to the responsibility of the opposition .
but the Berlusconi government , and the media directly or indi@@ rec@@ tly controlled by the prime minister , ch@@ ose a different communic@@ ation strategy .
they con@@ st@@ antly under@@ played the extent of the crisis , and tried to sell the idea that Italy had largely been insu@@ l@@ ated from the global recession .
this strategy may have prev@@ ented the dramatic fall in popul@@ ar@@ ity experienced by other governments in the middle of the Great Rec@@ ession , but so@@ on@@ er or later will back@@ fire . the dis@@ appoin@@ tment of the majority of Ita@@ li@@ ans with Berlusconi &apos;s rule will be even larger when they reali@@ ze that this government never pres@@ ented the fac@@ ts as they are .
the Economic Con@@ sequ@@ ences of the Arab Re@@ vol@@ t
new YORK - Politi@@ cal tur@@ mo@@ il in the Middle East has powerful economic and financial implications , particularly as it increases the risk of stag@@ flation , a le@@ th@@ al combination of slow@@ ing growth and sharply rising inflation .
indeed , should stag@@ flation emer@@ ge , there is a serious risk of a double @-@ di@@ p recession for a global economy that has ba@@ rely emerged from its worst crisis in decades .
severe un@@ rest in the Middle East has histori@@ cally been a source of oil @-@ price spi@@ kes , which in turn have trig@@ ger@@ ed three of the last five global rec@@ essions .
the Y@@ om Ki@@ p@@ pu@@ r War in 197@@ 3 caused a sharp increase in oil prices , leading to the global stag@@ flation of 197@@ 4 @-@ 197@@ 5 .
the Iranian revolution in 197@@ 9 led to a similar stag@@ flationary increase in oil prices , which cul@@ min@@ ated in the recession of 1980 @-@ 198@@ 1 .
and Iraq &apos;s inv@@ asion of Ku@@ wait in August 1990 led to a spi@@ ke in oil prices at a time when a US banking crisis was already ti@@ pp@@ ing America into recession .
oil prices also played a role in the recent finance @-@ driven global recession .
by the summer of 2008 , just before the collapse of L@@ eh@@ man Bro@@ thers , oil prices had doub@@ led over the previous 12 months , reaching a pe@@ ak of $ 1@@ 4@@ 8 a bar@@ re@@ l - and deli@@ vering the cou@@ p de gr@@ â@@ ce to an already fra@@ il and strugg@@ ling global economy bu@@ ff@@ et@@ ed by financial sho@@ cks .
we don &apos;t know yet whether political con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on in the Middle East will spread to other countries .
the tur@@ mo@@ il may yet be con@@ tained and rec@@ e@@ de , sen@@ ding oil prices back to lower levels .
but there is a serious chance that the u@@ pri@@ sin@@ gs will spread , destabili@@ zing B@@ ah@@ ra@@ in , Al@@ geri@@ a , O@@ man , Jord@@ an , Y@@ emen , and eventually even Saudi Arabia .
even before the recent Middle East political sho@@ cks , oil prices had ri@@ sen above $ 8@@ 0@@ - $ 90 a bar@@ re@@ l , an increase driven not only by energy @-@ thir@@ st@@ y emerging @-@ market economies , but also by non @-@ fundamental factors : a w@@ all of liquidity ch@@ asing assets and commodi@@ ties in emerging markets , owing to near @-@ zero interest rates and quantitative easing in advanced economies ; moment@@ um and her@@ ding behavior ; and limited and in@@ el@@ as@@ tic oil supp@@ lies .
if the threat of supply dis@@ rup@@ tions sp@@ read@@ s beyond Libya , even the m@@ ere risk of lower output may sharply increase the &quot; fear pre@@ mi@@ um &quot; via pre@@ cau@@ tion@@ ary sto@@ ck@@ p@@ il@@ ing of oil by investors and final us@@ ers .
the latest increases in oil prices - and the related increases in other commodity prices , especially food - imp@@ ly several un@@ fortun@@ ate consequences ( even leaving asi@@ de the risk of severe civil un@@ rest ) .
first , in@@ flationary pressure will grow in already @-@ over@@ he@@ ating emerging market economies , where oil and food prices represent up to two @-@ thir@@ ds of the consumption bas@@ k@@ et .
given weak demand in slow @-@ growing advanced economies , rising commodity prices may lead only to a small first @-@ round effect on head@@ line inflation there , with little second @-@ round impact on core inflation .
but advanced countries will not emer@@ ge uns@@ c@@ ath@@ ed .
indeed , the second risk posed by higher oil prices - a terms @-@ of @-@ trade and dis@@ pos@@ able income sho@@ ck to all energy and commodity impor@@ ters - will hit advanced economies especially hard , as they have ba@@ rely emerged from recession and are still experi@@ en@@ cing an an@@ emi@@ c recovery .
the third risk is that rising oil prices reduce invest@@ or confidence and increase risk a@@ version , leading to stock @-@ market correc@@ tions that have negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending .
business and consumer confidence are also likely to take a hit , further undermin@@ ing demand .
if oil prices rise much further - towards the pe@@ ak@@ s of 2008 - the advanced economies will slow sharply ; many might even s@@ li@@ p back into recession .
and , even if prices remain at current levels for most of the year , global growth will slow and inflation will rise .
what policy respon@@ ses are available to damp@@ en the risk of stag@@ flation ?
in the short run , there are very few : Saudi Arabia - the only O@@ P@@ EC produc@@ er with excess capacity - could increase its output , and the US could use its Strategi@@ c P@@ et@@ ro@@ le@@ um Reserve to increase the supply of oil .
over time - but this could take years - consumers could invest in alternative energy sources and reduce demand for fossil fuels via carbon taxes and new technologies .
because energy and food security are matters of economic as well as social and political stability , policies that reduce commodity @-@ price volati@@ lity should be in the interest of produc@@ ers and consumers .
but the time to act is now .
the transition from auto@@ cracy to democracy in the Middle East is likely to be bu@@ mp@@ y and un@@ stable , at best .
in countries with p@@ ent @-@ up demand for higher income and welfare , democratic fer@@ vor could lead to large budget deficits , excessive wage demands , and high inflation , ultimately resulting in severe economic crises .
so a b@@ old new assistance program should be designed for the region , mod@@ eled on the Mar@@ sh@@ all Plan in Western Europe after W@@ W@@ II , or on the support offered to Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall .
financing should come from the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank , the European Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development , as well as from bilateral support provided by the US , the European Union , China , and the Gul@@ f states .
the goal should be to stabili@@ ze these countries &quot; economies as they under@@ take their de@@ lic@@ ate political tran@@ si@@ tions .
the stak@@ es are high .
un@@ stable political tran@@ si@@ tions could lead to high levels of social dis@@ order , organi@@ zed violence , and / or civil war , fu@@ eling further economic and political tur@@ mo@@ il .
given the current risk @-@ sensi@@ tivity of oil prices , the pain would not be con@@ fin@@ ed to the Middle East .
the Economic Con@@ sequ@@ ences of War with Iraq
war with Iraq seems inevitable , with or without the support of the UN .
the economic costs of such a war could be huge , both in direct American out@@ la@@ ys for war and its after@@ mat@@ h , and in the indi@@ rec@@ t sp@@ il@@ lo@@ vers on the world economy .
this war would take place against a back@@ ground of weak economic conditions glob@@ ally , and would exac@@ erb@@ ate those weak@@ n@@ esses , perhaps thro@@ wing the world economy into recession .
the economic outcome of war could well depend on the diplomatic context .
if America acts alone , the likely costs of war to the world economy will be higher than if it has the bac@@ king of the UN .
the costs of war must be balanced against the costs of alternative actions .
a high cost of war is certainly not a case for in@@ action , especially in the face of a serious risk that Iraq could ob@@ tain , and eventually use , weapons of mass destruction .
yet pursu@@ ing war where diplomatic means - weapons in@@ spec@@ tions , threats of reta@@ li@@ ation in the face of Iraqi aggres@@ sion , read@@ iness of the UN to act if dang@@ ers from Iraq become im@@ min@@ ent - might su@@ ffi@@ ce could result in huge and avoi@@ dable economic ( as well as other ) costs .
the traditional tex@@ t@@ book view of war is that war stimul@@ ates an economy , at least in the short term .
but that simple view of war@@ time economics is too nar@@ row to descri@@ be the possible effects of an Iraqi war .
we must also recognize that a war with Iraq , even a limited war , could pro@@ found@@ ly dis@@ rupt the international flow of goods , services , and investments upon which our global economy now re@@ sts .
these dis@@ rup@@ tive effects would not only damp@@ en production , but would undermine invest@@ or and consumer confidence and thereby limit both private investment and consumer spending .
the direct macroeconomic stimulus that could ari@@ se from military spending may be overwhel@@ med by the uncertain@@ ties and dis@@ rup@@ tions that would ac@@ company military conflict .
such uncertain@@ ties are already vi@@ sible .
oil prices have ri@@ sen several dollars a bar@@ re@@ l since late summer .
since June , US and world stock markets have declin@@ ed by around 20 % in dollar terms .
each rise in the prob@@ ability of war has ten@@ ded to push the markets down further .
the modern world economy is built upon a complex net@@ work of global economic connec@@ tions , and those connec@@ tions are directly threat@@ ened by war .
war would pose obvious and direct risks to shi@@ pp@@ ing , not@@ ably shi@@ pp@@ ing of oil from the Middle East .
the increased costs could further de@@ press the drop of cross @-@ border capital flows that has been under@@ way for two years , since the end of the US stock market boom .
the decline in cross @-@ border flows intensi@@ fied after the September 11 attacks last year .
foreign direct investment in many developing regions has dri@@ ed up , and emerging markets that depend on such capital flows , particularly in South America , have seen their economies thro@@ wn into a rene@@ wed financial crisis .
even if the US economy might experience some short @-@ term demand boost from increased military spending , the rest of the world would not .
most countries would feel only negative effects - dis@@ rup@@ tions of trade , higher oil prices , withdra@@ w@@ als of international capital , c@@ ut@@ b@@ acks on investment plans - without any off@@ setting direct stimulus .
America &apos;s macroeconomic situation is also wor@@ ri@@ some .
the Bush Administration &apos;s fiscal policies , combined with the bur@@ sting of the US financial bubble of the late 199@@ 0s , have push@@ ed America on@@ to an un@@ stable fiscal tra@@ jec@@ tory .
in contrast to budget sur@@ pl@@ uses &quot; as far as the e@@ y@@ e could see , &quot; the US now has large budget deficits that will ling@@ er for many years to come .
war with Iraq would likely cause those budget deficits to so@@ ar .
rising budget deficits will po@@ is@@ on US domestic politics and lead to bud@@ get@@ ary gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck .
that in turn , could lead to a loss of consumer confidence .
since consumer spending has been the rema@@ ining bul@@ war@@ k of the US economy since the collapse of the financial bubble , war with Iraq could pun@@ c@@ ture the last point of stability in the US economy .
of course , US policymakers have a hi@@ d@@ den &quot; A@@ C@@ E in the hol@@ e . &quot;
they believe that the war will be qui@@ ck , virtually effor@@ t@@ less , and self @-@ financing , as the US@@ . effectively gains control of Iraqi oil supp@@ lies , which will not only drive down world oil prices but also finance Iraq &apos;s post@@ war re@@ construction .
an all@@ uring prospect , but perhaps impro@@ b@@ able .
war might not be qui@@ ck at all .
post@@ war Iraq could be un@@ stable even if the war is b@@ rief .
an alternative scenario is huge uncertainty and tur@@ mo@@ il throughout the Middle East , with major dis@@ rup@@ tions in oil flows , for political if not military reasons .
the geopolitical costs of a unilater@@ al US war will be even higher .
a qui@@ ck and successful war , strong@@ ly and exp@@ lic@@ it@@ ly backed by the UN , offers the greatest chance of avoi@@ ding a huge negative economic fall@@ out .
a war that p@@ its America against the world could call into doubt the progress of globalization , particularly international trade negotiations .
moreover , if the US acts alone , no doubt the post @-@ conflict costs that America will bear alone will be higher as well .
open and deep political divi@@ sions between America and other major countries will inci@@ te a loss of invest@@ or confidence , undermin@@ ing global economic stability .
the Economic Co@@ sts of Fe@@ ar
Ber@@ kel@@ ey - The S &amp; amp ; P stock inde@@ x now yi@@ elds a 7 % real ( inflation @-@ adju@@ sted ) return .
by contrast , the annual real interest rate on the five @-@ year United States Treasury Inflation @-@ Pro@@ t@@ ected Security ( T@@ IP@@ S ) is -@@ 1.@@ 0@@ 2 % .
yes , there is a &quot; min@@ us &quot; sign in front of that : if you buy the five @-@ year T@@ IP@@ S , each year over the next five years the US Treasury will pay you in interest the past year &apos;s consumer inflation rate min@@ us 1.@@ 0@@ 2 % .
even the annual real interest rate on the 30 @-@ year T@@ IP@@ S is only 0.@@ 6@@ 3 % - and you run a large risk that its value will decline at some point over the next generation , im@@ pl@@ ying a big loss if you need to sell it before mat@@ urity .
so , imagine that you invest $ 1@@ 0,000 in the S &amp; amp ; P inde@@ x .
this year , your share of the profits made by those companies will be $ 7@@ 00 .
now , imagine that , of that total , the companies pay out $ 2@@ 50 in divi@@ den@@ ds ( which you re@@ invest to buy more stock ) and re@@ tain $ 4@@ 50 in ear@@ nings to re@@ invest in their businesses .
if the companies &quot; man@@ ag@@ ers do their job , that re@@ investment will boost the value of your sha@@ res to $ 1@@ 0,@@ 4@@ 50 .
add to that the $ 2@@ 50 of new@@ ly @-@ b@@ ought sha@@ res , and next year the port@@ foli@@ o will be worth $ 1@@ 0,@@ 7@@ 00 - more if stock @-@ market valu@@ ations rise , and less if they fall .
in fact , over any past period long enough for wa@@ ves of op@@ ti@@ mism and p@@ essi@@ mism to canc@@ el each other out , the average ear@@ nings yi@@ eld on the S &amp; amp ; P inde@@ x has been a good gui@@ de to the return on the port@@ foli@@ o .
so , if you invest $ 1@@ 0,000 in the S &amp; amp ; P for the next five years , you can reason@@ ably expect ( with enormous up@@ side and down@@ side risks ) to make about 7 % per year , leaving you with a com@@ po@@ und@@ ed profi@@ t in inflation @-@ adju@@ sted dollars of $ 4,@@ 19@@ 1 .
if you invest $ 1@@ 0,000 in the five @-@ year T@@ IP@@ S , you can confi@@ d@@ ently expect a five @-@ year loss of $ 5@@ 10 .
that is an extra@@ ordinary gap in the returns that you can reason@@ ably expect .
it nat@@ ur@@ ally rais@@ es the question : why aren &apos;t people moving their money from T@@ IP@@ S ( and US Treasury bonds and other safe assets ) to sto@@ cks ( and other relatively risk@@ y assets ) ?
people have different reasons . and many people &apos;s thinking is not ter@@ ri@@ bly co@@ her@@ ent .
but there appear to be two main explan@@ ations .
first , many people are un@@ certain that current conditions will continue .
most economists forec@@ ast the world a year from now to look a lot like the world today , with unemployment and profi@@ t mar@@ g@@ ins about the same , wages and prices on average about 1.@@ 5 % higher , total production up roughly 2 % , and risks on both the up@@ side and the down@@ side .
but many investors see a substantial chance of 2008 and 2009 redu@@ x , whether trig@@ ger@@ ed by a full @-@ fle@@ dged euro crisis or by some bl@@ ack s@@ wan that we do not yet see , and fear that , unlike in 2008 and 2009 , governments would lack the power and will to c@@ us@@ hi@@ on the economic impact .
these investors do not view the 7 % annual return on sto@@ cks as an average expec@@ tation , with down@@ side risks counter@@ balanced by up@@ side opportunities .
rather , they see a good @-@ scenario outcome that only the fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy would trust .
second , many people do see the 7 % return on sto@@ cks as a reasonable expec@@ tation , and would jum@@ p at the chance to gra@@ b it - plus the opportunity of surpri@@ ses on the up@@ side - but they do not think that they can afford to run the down@@ side risks .
indeed , the world seems a much more risk@@ y place than it seemed five or ten years ago .
the burden of existing debts is high , and investors &quot; key goal is loss @-@ avoi@@ d@@ ance , not profi@@ t @-@ seeking .
both reasons reflect a massive failure of our economic institutions .
the first reason betra@@ ys a lack of trust that governments can and will do the job that they learned how to do in the Great Depression : keep the flow of spending stable so that big de@@ pres@@ sions with long @-@ la@@ sting , double @-@ di@@ gi@@ t unemployment do not rec@@ ur .
the second reve@@ als the financial industry &apos;s failure adequ@@ ately to mobili@@ ze society &apos;s risk @-@ be@@ aring capacity for the service of enterpri@@ se .
as individuals , we appear to view a g@@ am@@ ble that has a roughly 50 % chance of doub@@ ling our wealth and a roughly 50 % chance of hal@@ ving it as wor@@ thy of consider@@ ation - not a no @-@ bra@@ in@@ er , but not out of the question , either .
well @-@ func@@ tioning financial markets would mobili@@ ze that risk @-@ be@@ aring capacity and put it to use for the benefit of all , so that people who did not think that they could run the risks of stock ow@@ ner@@ ship could la@@ y that risk off on@@ to others for a reasonable fe@@ e .
as an economist , I find this state of affairs fru@@ str@@ ating .
we know , or at least we ought to know , how to build political institutions that accept the mission of macroeconomic stabili@@ zation , and how to build financial institutions to mobili@@ ze risk @-@ be@@ aring capacity and spread risk .
yet , to a remark@@ able degree , we have failed to do so .
the Economic F@@ uture of Egypt &apos;s Revolution
Cambridge - F@@ or Egypt , the question of the day is whether the country will build an open , democratic political system or rel@@ ap@@ se into some form - new or old - of auto@@ cracy .
but an equally important question - above all for Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , but also for other developing countries ( and for development experts ) - is the economic impact of its revolution .
for the past quarter @-@ century , a major agenda it@@ em for the international development organizations , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , has been to bol@@ ster developing nations &quot; financial markets .
stronger financial markets can move savings to where they can do the most to sp@@ ur economic growth .
and that capacity has been seen as one of the hand@@ ful of key pr@@ er@@ equi@@ si@@ tes for economic development .
making finance work should boost economic development significantly .
economic histori@@ ans point to financial re@@ volu@@ tions as setting the stage for strong economic development in England ( in the se@@ v@@ ent@@ e@@ enth and ei@@ gh@@ te@@ enth cent@@ uries , following the G@@ l@@ ori@@ ous Revolution ) , in the United States ( after Ale@@ x@@ ander H@@ ami@@ l@@ ton in the 17@@ 90 &quot; s built up major financial structures in a prim@@ arily agricultural country ) , and in Japan ( after the M@@ ei@@ j@@ i Re@@ stor@@ ation ) .
the World Bank , the IMF , and do@@ zens of academi@@ cs have stu@@ died long and hard what makes financial markets grow and what hol@@ ds them back .
many focus on the quality of institutions , such as cour@@ ts and tax authorities .
others emphasi@@ ze the quality of corporate law .
still others look at policies , like trade open@@ ness or Li@@ gh@@ tn@@ ess of tax@@ ation .
everyone ex@@ t@@ ols property rights .
yet , when one looks at what actually happen@@ s in developing countries , the lessons are dis@@ appoin@@ ting .
though some countries have fi@@ xed their court systems , stre@@ am@@ lin@@ ed their tax administ@@ ra@@ tions , and be@@ gun to get a hand@@ le on corruption , the impact on financial markets has been un@@ even .
worse still for some the@@ ories of what makes financial markets fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h are the exam@@ ples of the US , Great Britain , and Japan .
financial markets le@@ ap@@ ed forward in ei@@ gh@@ te@@ enth @-@ century Great Britain , and in the n@@ inet@@ e@@ enth and early twentieth cent@@ uries in Japan and the US - a time when several key institutions , such as corporate law and the court system , were wo@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly sub@@ standard .
American cour@@ ts in the n@@ inet@@ e@@ enth century were not@@ ably cor@@ rupt , sometimes in@@ comp@@ et@@ ent , and often ir@@ relevant , yet stock and bond markets gre@@ w , and continent @-@ sp@@ ann@@ ing firms ro@@ se up and go@@ t the financing they needed to operate , expand , and industri@@ alize the US economy .
the core protec@@ tive legal institution for outside finance , the federal securities laws , did@@ n &apos;t fall into place until the 19@@ 30 &quot; s - decades after US financial markets had grown to finance America &apos;s economic rise .
Britain and Japan seem to have followed the same sequ@@ ence : finance first , protec@@ tive institutions later .
Japan had no corporate law until complex business finance started developing at the end of the n@@ inet@@ e@@ enth century .
yet that sequ@@ ence is the opposi@@ te of what one might have expected : only after financial markets developed did those with a stak@@ e in them press for better legislation to protect investors .
so , in Britain , Japan , and the US , something more found@@ ational must have been in place before financial markets started oper@@ ating .
something else must aff@@ ect which countries are most likely to get strong finance , which won &apos;t , and when it all happen@@ s .
that &quot; something &quot; now usually seems to be basic political stability , prefer@@ ably of the democratic kind .
in a stable political environment , in@@ formal mechanisms - such as rep@@ ut@@ ations for reli@@ ability , trade associ@@ ations , and stock ex@@ changes - can develop and facilit@@ ate financial de@@ al@@ ings .
investors and businesses don &apos;t fear that a new regime can take power and call off all , or too many , be@@ ts , leading to losses on their investments .
the data lin@@ king democratic political instability and financial back@@ war@@ d@@ ness in the modern era , which Jord@@ an Sie@@ gel of the Har@@ v@@ ard B@@ us@@ iness Scho@@ ol and I analy@@ ze in a for@@ th@@ coming arti@@ cle , show un@@ mistak@@ ably that instability power@@ fully predic@@ ts an in@@ ability to develop financial markets .
democratic political stability is the most important har@@ b@@ ing@@ er of financial development .
there is a deep logi@@ c to this fin@@ ding .
even if all of the rules for finance are right , few will part with their money if they fear that an un@@ favor@@ able regime change might occur during the li@@ fe@@ time of their investment .
more import@@ antly , the gri@@ m stability of the type disp@@ la@@ yed by Ho@@ s@@ ni Mubarak &apos;s Egypt is of@@ ten@@ times in@@ sufficient for genuine financial development .
authoritarian regimes , especially those with severe income and wealth inequality , inher@@ ently create a risk of ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ar@@ iness , un@@ predic@@ tability , and instability .
they are themselves ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary .
and everyone knows that bene@@ ath the stability of the moment l@@ ur@@ k explo@@ sive forces that can change the regime and de@@ value huge investments .
because finan@@ ci@@ ers and sa@@ vers have limited confidence in the future , such regimes can &apos;t re@@ adi@@ ly build and maintain strong found@@ ations for financial development .
by contrast , democratic regimes with widespread property ow@@ ner@@ ship typically best protect property rights over the long term , because enough people in the poli@@ ty want to protect property .
yes , the rules of the game coun@@ t for finance . but what coun@@ ts even more is that the poli@@ ty has a continuing , stable stak@@ e in keeping those rules in place and making them work for finance and economic growth .
so , what does this mean for Egypt ?
the Egyp@@ tian revolution is political thus far , not economic .
yet , if the revolution leads to a more open , democratic , middle @-@ class @-@ ori@@ ented political system , in which enough people believe that they have a stak@@ e in the government &apos;s continu@@ ity , the economic benefits for Egyp@@ ti@@ ans could be large .
financial markets will more likely fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h , and more rapid and equ@@ itable development will more likely follow .
the Economic Govern@@ ance the EU Ne@@ e@@ ds
Brussels - T@@ wo lessons have emerged from Europe &apos;s financial crisis . first , there is no sub@@ stitu@@ te for tim@@ ely and coordin@@ ated action when the single currency is under pressure .
second , all eurozone countries are effectively in the same bo@@ at .
if the bo@@ at spr@@ ings a lea@@ k , everyone sin@@ ks .
a quick@@ er and more conc@@ er@@ ted response might have limited the fall @-@ out from the crisis , and thus its cost .
the European Financial Stabi@@ li@@ zation F@@ aci@@ lity ( E@@ FS@@ F ) , hur@@ rie@@ dly established in May 2010 in an effort to stop the ro@@ t , will shor@@ tly be able to call on some € 500 billion in the event that any more eurozone countries face serious liquidity problems .
and eurozone member states have agreed to per@@ pet@@ u@@ ate this financial @-@ stability mechanism from 2013 on@@ wards , and even to am@@ end the L@@ is@@ bon treaty to avoid any legal ambi@@ gu@@ ity .
despite all this , markets remain un@@ convinc@@ ed by the eurozone &apos;s shows of solidarity .
Greek sovereign debt has been down@@ gra@@ ded to below that of Egypt .
Portugal has had to ask for assistance from the E@@ FS@@ F and the International Monetary Fund .
I@@ ris@@ h banks repor@@ tedly need an additional € 24 billion to sta@@ y af@@ lo@@ at .
and Spain is doing all it can to avoid the con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on .
the ir@@ ony is that the euro has been a hu@@ g@@ ely successful project , bringing considerable stability to particip@@ ating countries .
indeed , without the single currency , many of these countries would have succ@@ um@@ bed to a down@@ ward spi@@ ral of de@@ val@@ uation , default , and re@@ course to the IMF .
the European Central Bank has played a crucial role in prev@@ enting a worst @-@ case scenario , but the obvious lac@@ un@@ a in Europe &apos;s economic and monetary union ( E@@ M@@ U ) remains : E@@ M@@ U established only a monetary union and largely om@@ it@@ ted the economic union that has pro@@ ven so clo@@ sely linked to the euro &apos;s streng@@ ths and weak@@ n@@ esses .
the real crisis facing Europe is one of economic governance .
eurozone member states have increasingly gone their own way , even over@@ tly def@@ ending nationalist economic policies that har@@ m the eurozone as a whole .
this is not to say that a single economic policy should be imposed on everyone ; but Europe does need a higher degree of coordin@@ ation and conver@@ gence to ensure that everyone is at least head@@ ing in the same direction .
like c@@ ars on a high@@ way , some may drive more slow@@ ly than others , but there are minim@@ um and ma@@ xim@@ um spe@@ e@@ ds and all must go with the flow of tra@@ ffi@@ c .
moreover , all mot@@ ori@@ sts must respect the rules of the road , and anyone who bre@@ aches them must be held to account , and possibly pen@@ alized , because even one ro@@ gue dri@@ ver will most likely cause a major pi@@ le @-@ up if not stopp@@ ed .
so it is with economic governance : an@@ arch@@ y would be de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
agreement is needed on both the rules and the im@@ parti@@ al body to en@@ force them .
European Union leaders have in recent sum@@ mi@@ ts come close to identi@@ fying a number of economic @-@ policy areas where closer coordin@@ ation would improve competitiveness , including sustain@@ ability of pen@@ sions , wage @-@ to @-@ productivity rati@@ os , corporate tax@@ ation , investment in research and development , and the financing of major infrastructure projects .
yet the same EU members have failed to en@@ do@@ w the European Commission with overall responsibility for holding member governments to their commitments and , where necessary , im@@ posing pen@@ al@@ ties for bre@@ aches .
this inter@@ govern@@ mental approach la@@ y behind the L@@ is@@ bon Agenda &apos;s failure to deliver the results needed to make Europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010 , and the same short@@ com@@ ings will be@@ devi@@ l its success@@ or , the new &quot; Europe 2020 &quot; strategy .
indeed , it is a failure of governance that has characteri@@ zed the St@@ ability and Gro@@ w@@ th P@@ act , designed ( largely by Germany ) to ensure sound macroeconomic policy by li@@ mit@@ ing national debt and deficit rati@@ os .
most eurozone members are now in bre@@ ach of the P@@ act , yet none has been sub@@ jected to the pen@@ al@@ ties en@@ vis@@ aged by its arch@@ it@@ ects .
recently adopted changes create a more sen@@ sible and gradu@@ ated system for sanc@@ tioning rec@@ al@@ c@@ it@@ r@@ ant countries , but still leave the decision to initi@@ ate an excessive deficit proce@@ dur@@ e to member states , rather than establishing the more automati@@ c mechanism sought by the European Commission .
meanwhile , the Commission already poli@@ ces the internal market - one of Europe &apos;s major policy succ@@ esses - by monit@@ oring member states &quot; compli@@ ance with the single market &apos;s rules .
it also laun@@ ches in@@ fr@@ in@@ gement proce@@ ed@@ ings against member states that have not implemented v@@ ali@@ d direc@@ tives on time , or in the correc@@ t man@@ ner .
similarly , EU competition policy has stood firm for many years against mon@@ o@@ poli@@ es and ab@@ use of domin@@ ant market positions .
here , too , the Commission pla@@ ys the role of ne@@ ut@@ ral ju@@ dge .
there may be disp@@ utes in some cases , but the system has brought a degree of legal certain@@ ty across the single market that the EU &apos;s member states could not have achieved on their own .
the challenge now for EU leaders is not to rep@@ ack@@ age old policies , but to ex@@ press a collective vision and will to act together .
I have been argu@@ ing for a Comm@@ unity Ac@@ t that would bring together all el@@ ements of economic governance under a single framework , with the European Commission at its center .
as with the single @-@ market program of the 1980 &quot; s , the Commission could be in char@@ ge of over@@ se@@ eing a conver@@ gence of national economic policies , within certain par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , throughout the EU .
stra@@ ying outside of those par@@ am@@ e@@ ters would lead to war@@ nings and sanctions , but otherwise there would be some flexi@@ bility for member states to pursue the EU &apos;s collective goals at a pace adap@@ ted to their national circumstances .
a c@@ lu@@ ster of EU com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ers holding economic @-@ related port@@ foli@@ os could even be made responsible for gui@@ ding the process forward , providing it with direction and moment@@ um .
if European countries are to emer@@ ge stronger from the current crisis , they need to think bi@@ g@@ ger and put more faith , not less , in the collective enterpri@@ se that is the EU .
after all , European uni@@ fication was conc@@ ei@@ ved as a project of po@@ ol@@ ed sovereignty , not sur@@ ren@@ dered prosperity .
the Economic im@@ per@@ atives of the Arab Spr@@ ing
Washington , DC / I@@ stan@@ bu@@ l - Al@@ most a year has pass@@ ed since revolution in T@@ uni@@ sia and protests in C@@ air@@ o &apos;s T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are t@@ op@@ pl@@ ed o@@ ssi@@ fied authoritarian regimes and ign@@ ited a much wider - and still ra@@ ging - stor@@ m in the Arab world .
no one can saf@@ ely predic@@ t where these events will eventually take the Arab people and nations .
but one thing is certain : there is no turning back .
new social and political movements and structures are emerging , power is shif@@ ting , and there is hope that democratic proc@@ esses will strengthen and spread across the Arab world in 2012 .
events in the Arab world in 2011 rec@@ all other far @-@ reaching regional tran@@ si@@ tions , such as in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
there are differences , of course , but the up@@ heav@@ als &quot; s@@ we@@ eping and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous nature is strong@@ ly similar to that of the re@@ volu@@ tions that brought commun@@ ism to an end in Europe .
so , too , is the debate about the relative contribu@@ tions of political and economic factors to the event@@ ual er@@ up@@ tion of popular prot@@ est .
while the ye@@ ar@@ ning for dig@@ n@@ ity , freedom of ex@@ pression , and real democratic participation was the driving force underlying the Arab re@@ volu@@ tions , economic dis@@ con@@ tent played a vital role , and economic factors will help to determine how the transition in the Arab world un@@ fol@@ ds . &amp; nbsp ; H@@ ere , three fundamental and longer @-@ term challenges are worth be@@ aring in mind .

first , growth will have to be much more inclu@@ sive , especially in terms of job creation .
the y@@ outh employment @-@ to @-@ population ratio was about 27 % in the Arab countries in 2008 , compared to 5@@ 3 % in East Asia .
moreover , income inequality has wi@@ den@@ ed , with the global phen@@ om@@ en@@ on of increasing concent@@ ration of wealth at the top very pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ced in many Arab countries .
top incomes in these countries have resul@@ ted largely from political pat@@ r@@ on@@ age , rather than from innovation and hard work .
while T@@ uni@@ sia was an extreme case of a regime fur@@ ther@@ ing the economic interests of a small cli@@ que of insi@@ ders , the pattern was widespread .
that is why a k@@ ne@@ e @-@ j@@ er@@ k , simp@@ li@@ stic &quot; Washington Con@@ sensus &quot; pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of more liberalization and privati@@ zation is in@@ appropriate for the Arab world in 2012 .
there is a clear political need for a growth strategy in which inclu@@ sion is the c@@ enter@@ pi@@ ece , not an after@@ thought .
neither the old st@@ ati@@ st left , nor the r@@ ent @-@ seeking , cr@@ ony @-@ capit@@ alist right had policies to respond to the ye@@ ar@@ ning for inclu@@ sion .
new political forces in the Arab world , Islam @-@ in@@ spi@@ red or social @-@ democratic , will have to pro@@ pose policies that do not just per@@ pet@@ u@@ ate r@@ ent @-@ seeking capitalism or reli@@ ance on a dis@@ credi@@ ted state bureau@@ cracy .
it will be necessary to har@@ ness gra@@ ss @-@ ro@@ ots d@@ yn@@ a@@ mism and entrep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al potential to achieve social solidarity and equity .
while a truly competitive private sector has to be un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed , the state must not be weak@@ ened but trans@@ formed , to become one that is at the service of citizens .
gener@@ ous but targe@@ ted and performance @-@ ori@@ ented social transfers , condi@@ tional on participation in health and basic education programs , will have to re@@ place the old , largely un@@ targe@@ ted subsidies .
public development finance will have to focus on large @-@ scale access to housing and a people @-@ ori@@ ented infrastructure .
all of this has to be achieved within a sustainable budget framework , requ@@ iring both funds and comprehensive administ@@ rative reforms .
ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ying inclu@@ sive growth , the second challenge is skil@@ l development , for which a performance @-@ ori@@ ented education system must become a top priority .
many Arab countries have spent huge su@@ ms on education ; the problem is that the return on these investments has been dis@@ mal .
Arab students , for example , s@@ core well below average on international ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs and science tests .
deep reforms - focused on quality and performance , rather than on en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment and diplom@@ as - are needed to trans@@ form the lear@@ ning process and un@@ le@@ as@@ h the productivity growth that a young labor force requires .
the third challenge , instru@@ mental to meeting the first two , will be to strengthen regional Arab solidarity .
many out@@ si@@ ders under@@ estim@@ ate or pur@@ pos@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly mini@@ mi@@ ze the &quot; Ara@@ b@@ ness &quot; of the Arab world .
but the re@@ volu@@ tions of 2011 demonstrated that a strong sense of identity , a common language , and much shared history bin@@ d Ara@@ bs together , despite huge differences in natural @-@ resource en@@ dow@@ ments , political circumstances , and average per capita incomes .
how else can one explain that an act of re@@ vol@@ t in T@@ uni@@ sia led to popular re@@ vol@@ ts from North Africa to the Arabi@@ an Pen@@ insu@@ la ?
one implic@@ ation of this is that the oil @-@ rich states and leaders cannot expect to remain isol@@ ated and prot@@ ected from the un@@ fol@@ ding events .
the future of the region is also their future ; the transition that started in 2011 un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed forces that cannot be stopp@@ ed .
but the transition can be more or@@ der@@ ly , more peaceful , and less dis@@ rup@@ tive if states that comm@@ and immen@@ se resources and wealth gener@@ ously support the poor@@ er countries - and back the reforms that all Arab countries need .
existing institutions with pro@@ ven tra@@ ck recor@@ ds , such as the Arab Fund , can help , but this requires sc@@ aling up their funds dramatically .
prosperity and peace in the region will depend on thinking big and ac@@ ting fast .
the re@@ volu@@ tions of 2011 are a histori@@ c opportunity for all Ara@@ bs .
making the most of it will require re@@ alism , coura@@ ge , willingness to change , and a read@@ iness to support change , particularly among those who have the greatest means to do so .
the Economi@@ cs of H@@ app@@ iness
new YORK - W@@ e live in a time of high an@@ xi@@ ety .
despite the world &apos;s unprecedented total wealth , there is vast in@@ security , un@@ rest , and dis@@ satis@@ fac@@ tion .
in the United States , a large majority of Americans believe that the country is &quot; on the wrong tra@@ ck . &quot;
p@@ essi@@ mism has so@@ ared .
the same is true in many other places .
against this back@@ drop , the time has come to re@@ consider the basic sources of happ@@ iness in our economic life .
the rel@@ ent@@ less pursu@@ it of higher income is leading to unprecedented inequality and an@@ xi@@ ety , rather than to greater happ@@ iness and life satis@@ fac@@ tion .
economic progress is important and can great@@ ly improve the quality of life , but only if it is pursu@@ ed in line with other goals .
in this respect , the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an Kingdom of B@@ h@@ utan has been leading the way .
for@@ ty years ago , B@@ h@@ utan &apos;s fo@@ ur@@ th king , young and new@@ ly inst@@ all@@ ed , made a remark@@ able choice : B@@ h@@ utan should pursue &quot; gro@@ ss national happ@@ iness &quot; rather than gro@@ ss national product .
since then , the country has been experi@@ ment@@ ing with an alternative , ho@@ li@@ stic approach to development that emphasi@@ zes not only economic growth , but also culture , mental health , comp@@ as@@ sion , and community .
do@@ zens of experts recently ga@@ ther@@ ed in B@@ h@@ utan &apos;s capital , T@@ hi@@ mp@@ h@@ u , to take stock of the country &apos;s record .
I was co @-@ host with B@@ h@@ utan &apos;s prime minister , J@@ ig@@ me T@@ hin@@ le@@ y , a leader in sustainable development and a great ch@@ amp@@ i@@ on of the conc@@ ept of &quot; G@@ N@@ H . &quot;
we ass@@ em@@ b@@ led in the w@@ ake of a dec@@ lar@@ ation in July by the United Nations General As@@ sem@@ bly call@@ ing on countries to exam@@ ine how national policies can promote happ@@ iness in their societies .
all who ga@@ ther@@ ed in T@@ hi@@ mp@@ h@@ u agreed on the importance of pursu@@ ing happ@@ iness rather than pursu@@ ing national income .
the question we exam@@ ined is how to achieve happ@@ iness in a world that is characteri@@ zed by rapid ur@@ b@@ anization , mass media , global capitalism , and environmental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation .
how can our economic life be re @-@ or@@ dered to re@@ create a sense of community , trust , and environmental sustain@@ ability ?
here are some of the ini@@ tial conclu@@ sions .
first , we should not deni@@ gr@@ ate the value of economic progress .
when people are h@@ ung@@ ry , de@@ pri@@ ved of basic needs such as cle@@ an water , health care , and education , and without mean@@ ing@@ ful employment , they suffer .
economic development that alle@@ vi@@ ates poverty is a vital step in boo@@ sting happ@@ iness .
second , rel@@ ent@@ less pursu@@ it of G@@ N@@ P to the exclu@@ sion of other goals is also no path to happ@@ iness .
in the US , G@@ N@@ P has ri@@ sen sharply in the past 40 years , but happ@@ iness has not .
instead , single @-@ min@@ ded pursu@@ it of G@@ N@@ P has led to great ine@@ quali@@ ties of wealth and power , fu@@ eled the growth of a vast under@@ class , tra@@ pped millions of children in poverty , and caused serious environmental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation .
third , happ@@ iness is achieved through a balanced approach to life by both individuals and societies .
as individuals , we are un@@ happ@@ y if we are deni@@ ed our basic material needs , but we are also un@@ happ@@ y if the pursu@@ it of higher incomes re@@ places our focus on family , fri@@ ends , community , comp@@ as@@ sion , and maintaining internal balance .
as a society , it is one thing to organi@@ ze economic policies to keep living standards on the rise , but quite another to sub@@ ordin@@ ate all of society &apos;s values to the pursu@@ it of profi@@ t .
yet politics in the US has increasingly allowed corporate profits to domin@@ ate all other as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions : fair@@ ness , justice , trust , physical and mental health , and environmental sustain@@ ability .
corporate campaign contribu@@ tions increasingly undermine the democratic process , with the bl@@ ess@@ ing of the US Su@@ pre@@ me Court .
fo@@ ur@@ th , global capitalism pres@@ ents many direct threats to happ@@ iness .
it is destro@@ ying the natural environment through climate change and other kin@@ ds of pollu@@ tion , while a rel@@ ent@@ less stream of oil @-@ industry pro@@ paganda ke@@ ep@@ s many people ignor@@ ant of this .
it is weak@@ ening social trust and mental stability , with the pre@@ val@@ ence of cl@@ ini@@ cal de@@ pression appar@@ ently on the rise .
the mass media have become out@@ le@@ ts for corporate &quot; mess@@ aging , &quot; much of it over@@ tly anti @-@ scientific , and Americans suffer from an increasing range of consumer ad@@ dic@@ tions .
consider how the fast @-@ food industry uses o@@ ils , f@@ ats , su@@ gar , and other ad@@ dic@@ tive ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents to create un@@ healthy depen@@ den@@ cy on fo@@ ods that contribute to o@@ be@@ si@@ ty .
one @-@ third of all Americans are now ob@@ ese .
the rest of the world will eventually follow unless countries restric@@ t dangerous corporate practices , including ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing un@@ healthy and ad@@ dic@@ tive fo@@ ods to young children .
the problem is not just fo@@ ods .
mass ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing is contribu@@ ting to many other consumer ad@@ dic@@ tions that imp@@ ly large public @-@ health costs , including excessive T@@ V wat@@ ching , g@@ am@@ b@@ ling , drug use , ci@@ ga@@ ret@@ te smo@@ king , and al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ sm .
fif@@ th , to promote happ@@ iness , we must identi@@ fy the many factors other than G@@ N@@ P that can raise or lower society &apos;s well @-@ being .
most countries invest to measure G@@ N@@ P , but spend little to identi@@ fy the sources of poor health ( like fast fo@@ ods and excessive T@@ V wat@@ ching ) , declining social trust , and environmental de@@ gra@@ d@@ ation .
once we understand these factors , we can act .
the ma@@ d pursu@@ it of corporate profits is threat@@ ening us all .
to be sure , we should support economic growth and development , but only in a broader context : one that promot@@ es environmental sustain@@ ability and the values of comp@@ as@@ sion and hon@@ est@@ y that are required for social trust .
the se@@ arch for happ@@ iness should not be con@@ fin@@ ed to the be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful moun@@ tain k@@ ingdom of B@@ h@@ utan .
the Un@@ star@@ v@@ able be@@ ast
Cambridge - A@@ s the world wat@@ ches the United States gra@@ pp@@ le with its fiscal future , the con@@ to@@ urs of the battle reflect larger social and philosop@@ hi@@ cal divi@@ sions that are likely to play out in various gu@@ is@@ es around the world in the coming decades .
there has been much discussion of how to cut government spending , but too little attention has been de@@ voted to how to make government spending more effective .
and yet , without more cre@@ ative appro@@ aches to providing government services , their cost will continue to rise in@@ ex@@ or@@ ably over time .
any service @-@ intensive industry faces the same challenges .
back in the 19@@ 60 &quot; s , the economists W@@ illi@@ am B@@ au@@ mo@@ l and W@@ illi@@ am Bo@@ w@@ en w@@ ro@@ te about the &quot; cost disease &quot; that pla@@ gu@@ es these industries .
the example they fam@@ ously used was that of a Mo@@ z@@ art str@@ ing quar@@ tet , which requires the same number of mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans and instru@@ ments in modern times as it did in the n@@ inet@@ e@@ enth century .
similarly , it takes about the same amount of time for a te@@ acher to gra@@ de a pap@@ er as it did 100 years ago .
good pl@@ um@@ bers cost a small fortun@@ e , because here , too , the technology has e@@ vol@@ ved very slow@@ ly .
why does slow productivity growth trans@@ late into high costs ?
the problem is that service industries ultimately have to compe@@ te for workers in the same national labor po@@ ol as sectors with fast productivity growth , such as finance , manufacturing , and information technology .
even though the po@@ ols of workers may be some@@ what se@@ g@@ ment@@ ed , there is enough over@@ la@@ p that it forces service @-@ intensive industries to pay higher wages , at least in the long run .
the government , of course , is the consu@@ mm@@ ate service @-@ intensive sector .
government employe@@ es include te@@ ach@@ ers , poli@@ c@@ emen , tra@@ sh collec@@ tors , and military person@@ ne@@ l .
modern schools look a lot more like those of 50 years ago than do modern manufacturing pl@@ ants .
and , while military innovation has been spec@@ tac@@ ular , it is still very labor @-@ intensive .
if people want the same level of government services relative to other things that they consu@@ me , government spending will take up a larger and larger share of national output over time .
indeed , not only has government spending been rising as a share of income ; so , too , has spending across many service sectors .
today , the service sector , including the government , accounts for more than 70 % of national income in most advanced economies .
agri@@ culture , which in the 18@@ 00 &quot; s accoun@@ ted for more than half of national income , has shr@@ un@@ k to just a few perc@@ ent .
manufacturing employment , which accoun@@ ted for perhaps a third of jobs or more before World War II , has shr@@ un@@ k dramatically .
in the US , for example , the manufacturing sector emplo@@ ys less than 10 % of all workers .
so , even as economic con@@ serv@@ atives demand spending cuts , there are strong forces push@@ ing in the other direction .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , the problem is worse in the government sector , where productivity growth is much s@@ lower even than in other service industries .
whereas this might reflect the particular mi@@ x of services that governments are asked to provide , that can hardly be the whole story .
surely , part of the problem is that governments use employment not just to provide services , but also to make impli@@ cit transfers .
moreover , government agencies operate in many areas in which they face little competition - and thus little pressure to innov@@ ate .
why not bring greater private @-@ sector invol@@ vement , or at least competition , into government ?
education , where the power of modern dis@@ rup@@ tive technologies has ba@@ rely been felt , would be a good place to start .
s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated compu@@ ter programs are becoming quite good at gra@@ ding middle @-@ school ess@@ a@@ ys , if not quite up to the standards of top te@@ ach@@ ers .
infrastructure is another obvious place to expand private @-@ sector invol@@ vement .
once upon a time , for example , it was widely believed that dri@@ vers on priv@@ ately oper@@ ated ro@@ ads would con@@ st@@ antly be wa@@ iting to pay t@@ oll@@ s .
modern tran@@ sp@@ on@@ ders and automati@@ c pay@@ ment systems , however , have made that a non @-@ issue .
but one should not pre@@ su@@ me that a shift to greater private @-@ sector provi@@ sion of services is a pan@@ ac@@ e@@ a .
there would still be a need for regulation , especially where mon@@ opo@@ ly or near @-@ mon@@ opo@@ ly is involved .
and there would still be a need to decide how to balance efficiency and equity in the provi@@ sion of services .
education is clearly an area in which any country has a strong national interest in providing a level playing field .
as US President in the 1980 &quot; s , the conservative i@@ c@@ on R@@ onald Reagan descri@@ bed his approach to fiscal policy as &quot; star@@ ve the be@@ ast &quot; : cutting taxes will eventually force people to accept less government spending .
in many ways , his approach was a great success .
but government spending has continued to grow , because voters still want the services that government provides .
today , it is clear that re@@ ining in government also means fin@@ ding ways to shape incentives so that innovation in government ke@@ ep@@ s pace with innovation in other service sectors .
without more ideas about how to innov@@ ate in the provi@@ sion of government services , batt@@ les such as one se@@ es playing out in the US today can only become worse , as voters are increasingly asked to pay more for less .
politicians can and will promise to do a better job , but they cannot succeed unless we identi@@ fy ways to boost government services &quot; efficiency and productivity .
the Economi@@ cs of Strategi@@ c Con@@ tain@@ ment
new D@@ E@@ L@@ H@@ I - A@@ t their recent summit in C@@ ann@@ es , the G @-@ 20 sh@@ el@@ ved , if not bu@@ ried , the World Trade Organization &apos;s mor@@ i@@ b@@ und D@@ oh@@ a Development Ro@@ und of multilateral trade negotiations .
crisis @-@ we@@ ary Europe and America face a rising ti@@ de of protection@@ ism at home , and are trying to find ways to bl@@ un@@ t the ed@@ ge of China &apos;s non @-@ transpar@@ ent trade competitiveness .
turning his attention from the Atlanti@@ c to the P@@ aci@@ fic , US President Barack Obama - with his e@@ y@@ e , once again , tra@@ ined on China - has now un@@ v@@ ei@@ led a new regional trade initiative .
why was the US un@@ willing to move forward on the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und , but willing to pursue a regional free @-@ trade agreement ?
the answer lies in the fact that the Tr@@ ans @-@ P@@ aci@@ fic Partner@@ ship ( T@@ PP ) , launched by Obama and the governments of eight other P@@ aci@@ fic economies - Australia , Br@@ un@@ ei , Chile , Malaysia , New Z@@ e@@ al@@ and , Per@@ u , Singap@@ ore , and Vietnam - is not just about trade .
while Obama ch@@ ose to sti@@ ck to the economic factors driving the T@@ PP , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , on the e@@ ve of the just @-@ conclu@@ ded Asia P@@ aci@@ fic Economic Co@@ operation ga@@ ther@@ ing in Ha@@ wa@@ i@@ i , la@@ id out the initiative &apos;s wider strategic context .
&quot; the United States will continue to make the case that .@@ ... &#91; the region &#93; must pursue not just more growth , but better growth , &quot; which &quot; is not merely a matter of economics , &quot; Clinton said .
&quot; open@@ ness , freedom , transparency , and fair@@ ness have mean@@ ing far beyond the business re@@ al@@ m , &quot; she continued .
&quot; just as the United States advoc@@ ates for them in an economic context , we also advoc@@ ate for them in political and social con@@ tex@@ ts . &quot;
following up on these remark@@ s , Obama dre@@ w attention to per@@ sist@@ ent US concern about China &apos;s exchange @-@ rate policy , in@@ adequate protection of intellectual property , and impe@@ di@@ ments to market access .
&quot; for an economy like the United States - where our biggest competitive advantage is our knowledge , our innovation , our pat@@ ents , our co@@ p@@ y@@ rights - for us not to get the kind of protection we need in a large mark@@ et@@ place like China is not acceptable , &quot; Obama obser@@ ved .
the T@@ PP initiative should be viewed against this back@@ ground , and not just in the context of the collapse of the D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und .
the T@@ PP &apos;s n@@ ine sp@@ on@@ s@@ ors have resol@@ ved &quot; to establish a comprehensive , next @-@ generation regional agreement that liber@@ ali@@ zes trade and investment and addres@@ ses new and traditional trade issues and twenty @-@ first @-@ century challenges . &quot;
these leaders also agreed to fast @-@ tra@@ ck the T@@ PP initiative , and to consider opening it to other members - most import@@ antly Japan , a late conver@@ t to the idea of a P@@ aci@@ fic region free @-@ trade agreement .
the T@@ PP &apos;s agenda is divided into three c@@ ateg@@ ories : core , cross @-@ cutting , and emerging issues .
the core agenda is to sti@@ t@@ ch together a traditional free @-@ trade agreement focused on industrial goods , agri@@ culture , and tex@@ ti@@ les .
the agreement would also have provi@@ sions for intellectual @-@ property protection and what are du@@ b@@ bed the social and environmental issues .
in short , the T@@ PP &apos;s core agenda will offer the region a &quot; D@@ oh@@ a Ro@@ und @-@ type &quot; agreement that includes the social and environmental agenda that developing economies have been resist@@ ing within the WTO .
going beyond the core , the cross @-@ cutting issues include invest@@ or @-@ fri@@ end@@ ly regulatory systems and policies that enable &quot; innovative &quot; or &quot; employment @-@ creating &quot; small and medium @-@ size enterpri@@ ses to operate fre@@ ely across borders within the T@@ PP region .
finally , the T@@ PP se@@ eks to bring into the am@@ bit of a trade and investment agreement &quot; new and emerging &quot; issues .
these include &quot; trade and investment in innovative products and services , including digit@@ al technologies , and ensuring state @-@ owned enterpri@@ ses compe@@ te fair@@ ly with private companies and do not dist@@ ort competition in ways that put US companies and workers at a dis@@ advantage . &quot;
in short , the US has mo@@ ved to bring together all of the economies in the region that are wor@@ ried about China &apos;s beg@@ gar @-@ thy @-@ neighb@@ or trade and exchange @-@ rate policies .
for the US , the eight other T@@ PP countries , with a combined population of 200 million , constitu@@ te its fo@@ ur@@ th largest export market , behind only China , the European Union , and Japan .
if Japan jo@@ ins , the T@@ PP &apos;s importance would rise dramatically .
while the economics of the T@@ PP is important , the strategic comp@@ on@@ ent is even more so .
this is the second le@@ g of America &apos;s new &quot; P@@ aci@@ fic offen@@ sive , &quot; aimed at off@@ ering nations in the region an alternative to excessive and rapidly growing dependence on a rising China .
the first le@@ g of the offen@@ sive was the idea of the &quot; In@@ do @-@ P@@ aci@@ fic &quot; region , which Clinton developed a year ago and followed up this year with an ess@@ ay called &quot; America &apos;s P@@ aci@@ fic Cent@@ ury . &quot;
there , she defin@@ es the new region of US strategic enga@@ gement as &quot; stre@@ t@@ ching from the Indian sub@@ continent to the west@@ ern sho@@ res of the Ameri@@ c@@ as . &quot;
exten@@ ding e@@ ast from the Indian O@@ ce@@ an and w@@ est via the P@@ aci@@ fic , the US is creating a new strategic framework for the twenty @-@ first century .
the T@@ PP is just one of the p@@ ill@@ ars of that new edi@@ fi@@ ce .
the Econ@@ om@@ y and the Pre@@ siden@@ cy
Cambridge - America &apos;s presidential election is now just six months away .
if history is a reli@@ able gui@@ de , the outcome will depend significantly on the economy &apos;s performance between now and November 6 , and on Americans &quot; perc@@ eption of their economic future under the two candidates .
at the moment , America &apos;s economy is li@@ mp@@ ing along with slow growth and high unemployment .
output gre@@ w by just 1.@@ 5 % last year , and real GDP per capita is lower now than before the economic down@@ turn began at the end of 2007 .
although annual GDP growth was 3 % in the fo@@ ur@@ th quarter of 2011 , more than half of that reflected inv@@ ent@@ ory accumul@@ ation .
final s@@ ales to households , businesses , and foreign bu@@ yers ro@@ se at only a 1.@@ 1 % annual rate , even s@@ lower than earlier in the year .
and the pre@@ li@@ min@@ ary estim@@ ate for annual GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012 was a dis@@ appoin@@ ting 2.@@ 2 % , with only a 1.@@ 6 % rise in final s@@ ales .
the labor market has been similarly dis@@ appoin@@ ting .
the March unemployment rate of 8@@ .@@ 2 % was nearly three percentage points above what most economists would consider a desi@@ rable and sustainable long @-@ run level rate .
although the rate was down from 9 % a year ago , about half of the change reflected a rise in the number of people who have stopp@@ ed looking for work , rather than an increase in job creation and the employment rate .
indeed , the official unemployment rate under@@ states the weak@@ ness of the labor market .
an estimated 6 % of all employe@@ es are working fewer hours per week than they would like , and about 2 % of potential employe@@ es are not coun@@ ted as un@@ employ@@ ed because they have not loo@@ ked for work in the past few weeks , even though they would like to work .
ad@@ ding these individuals to those offici@@ ally classi@@ fied as un@@ employ@@ ed implies that about 15 % of potential labor @-@ force particip@@ ants are working less than they want .
soli@@ d increases in pay@@ ro@@ ll employment at the start of the year contribu@@ ted to a general sense of confidence .
but the rate of increase in pay@@ ro@@ ll employment fell in March to less than half of the rate recor@@ ded in previous months , and the number of workers claim@@ ing unemployment benefits recently j@@ ump@@ ed to a four @-@ month high .
even those who are working are se@@ eing their incomes shr@@ in@@ k .
real average we@@ ek@@ ly ear@@ nings have fallen in recent months , and are now lower than they were 18 months ago .
the broader measure of real per capita after @-@ tax personal income has also been falling , and is back to levels last seen a year ago .
despite their declining incomes , households raised their spending in early 2012 at a rapid pace by cutting their saving rate to just 3.@@ 7 % .
without further dec@@ lines in the saving rate from this very low level , consumer spending will not continue to grow as robu@@ stly .
recent re@@ ports of declining consumer confidence rein@@ force the like@@ li@@ hood that spending will slow in the months ahead .
moreover , the housing market remains in bad shape .
the most reli@@ able inde@@ x of compar@@ able house prices has continued to decline month after month , and prices are now about 7 % lower in real terms than a year ago , im@@ pl@@ ying a $ 1 trillion loss of household wealth .
with roughly 25 % of all hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ners with mortg@@ ages owing more than their homes are worth , the decline in house prices reflects high rates of default and forec@@ los@@ ure .
falling prices , together with stric@@ ter lending standards , has sp@@ ur@@ red a shift by would @-@ be home bu@@ yers to the r@@ ent@@ al market , causing recent dec@@ lines in the s@@ ales of both new and existing homes .
the weak@@ ness of America &apos;s economy is not limited to the household sector .
industrial production has been un@@ changed for the past two months , and uti@@ li@@ zation of industrial capacity has declin@@ ed .
and the mon@@ th@@ ly purch@@ asing sur@@ ve@@ ys conduc@@ ted by the Institute for S@@ up@@ ply Man@@ agement now indic@@ ate weak@@ er activity among service firms as well .
looking ahead , strong head@@ win@@ ds imp@@ ly that it will be difficult to achieve better economic performance in the rest of the year .
higher energy prices are reducing real household spending on non @-@ energy goods and services ; weak@@ ness in Europe and Asia will hur@@ t America &apos;s exports ; state and local governments are cutting their spending ; and concerns about higher taxes in 2013 will damp@@ en both business investment and big @-@ ti@@ ck@@ et consumer spending .
the economy is thus shap@@ ing up to be a serious li@@ ability for President Barack Obama , who is likely to place the blame on the conditions that he inher@@ ited from President George W. Bush , and on the Republican majority in the House of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives .
but the public is likely to place the blame on the president , and sur@@ ve@@ ys indic@@ ate that a growing number of Americans believe that Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , the almost certain Republican candidate , would do a better job than Obama at man@@ aging the economy .
the poll@@ s are very close , and voters have not yet lock@@ ed in their decisions .
the economy could rise more sharply than expected in the months ahead .
if not , Obama will try to shift attention from the overall economy by emphasi@@ zing his plan to raise taxes on high @-@ income individuals .
and a vari@@ ety of other issues , including immigration and the role of women , might influence voters .
but the state of the economy is usually the most important determin@@ ant of who w@@ ins national elections in the United States .
and US economic conditions now favor Rom@@ ney .
the Econ@@ om@@ y of Fe@@ ar
the global economy seems to be wal@@ king on water , shr@@ u@@ gg@@ ing off so@@ aring oil prices , policy par@@ aly@@ sis in Europe , un@@ sustainable borrowing by the United States , and record housing prices .
is it because , as G @-@ 8 leaders would have us believe , investors are in a bu@@ o@@ y@@ ant mo@@ od , confi@@ dent in their leaders &quot; ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship of the global economy ?
or are we being govern@@ ed by a pa@@ th@@ ology of fear , f@@ ed by events such as the recent London bom@@ b@@ ings , that is holding down long @-@ term interest rates thereby co@@ vering up a host of si@@ mm@@ ering problems ?
the role of phen@@ om@@ en@@ ally low long @-@ term ( inflation @-@ adju@@ sted ) interest rates in co@@ vering up a multi@@ tu@@ de of weak@@ n@@ esses in the global economy is all too appar@@ ent .
so@@ aring house prices worldwide are pro@@ pp@@ ing up consumer demand in many countries , and , according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund , contin@@ ually falling long @-@ term interest rates explain two @-@ thir@@ ds or more of the global price rise .
Europe has benef@@ ited less , but its economies would be a lot worse off if long @-@ term interest rates c@@ lim@@ bed back to their 25 @-@ year average .
similarly , Latin America has been bo@@ om@@ ing in recent years , despite high debt bur@@ dens and a mi@@ xed record of policy reform .
low long @-@ term interest rates have kept the region &apos;s debts man@@ a@@ ge@@ able , while high consumer demand has helped bi@@ d up prices for the region &apos;s commodity exports .
why h@@ as@@ n &apos;t the huge spi@@ ke in oil prices cut the world to its k@@ ne@@ es , as it has on so many other occ@@ a@@ sions ?
again , the answer is low interest rates .
ordin@@ arily , a sharp rise in oil prices quickly trans@@ l@@ ates into higher inflation expectations , followed by rising interest rates at all mat@@ urities .
but this time , even as the US Federal Reserve ke@@ ep@@ s hi@@ king its short @-@ term lending rate to keep inflation in line , long @-@ term interest rates - which are far more important - have been ma@@ gi@@ cally declining .
indeed , America has been the single biggest bene@@ fici@@ ary of this fre@@ ak@@ ish low @-@ interest @-@ rate environment , with everyone seem@@ ing to borro@@ w money like it is going out of style .
hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ners , backed by rising house prices , are p@@ il@@ ing up debt .
the Federal government has thro@@ wn fiscal p@@ ru@@ dence out the win@@ do@@ w .
the country as a whole is absor@@ bing an ast@@ o@@ und@@ ing three @-@ quar@@ ters of global excess savings .
but , as long as interest rates remain low and growth high , Americans can lau@@ gh at predic@@ tions that their exc@@ esses are la@@ ying the se@@ e@@ ds of ru@@ in .
but if low long @-@ term interest rates are helping so many economies wal@@ k on water , why are rates so low , and will they sta@@ y that way ?
perhaps the situation is far more fragi@@ le than many policymakers would have us believe .
perhaps people have come to feel less , not more , secure about their long @-@ term future , either because of fears about terrorism , a global pan@@ demi@@ c , or a severe ra@@ sh of financial crises .
I am not claim@@ ing that investors are hy@@ st@@ eri@@ cal , just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long @-@ term out@@ look .
as a consequ@@ ence , they are crow@@ ding into bonds and debt instru@@ ments that they view , ri@@ gh@@ tly or wr@@ ong@@ ly , as safe v@@ ehi@@ cles .
other convinc@@ ing explan@@ ations are lac@@ king .
to be sure , emerging markets have been on an un@@ usual savings spre@@ e , re@@ building reserves and improving balance she@@ ets , but no@@ body expec@@ ts this to go on fore@@ ver .
even US Federal Reserve Cha@@ ir@@ man Al@@ an Greensp@@ an ordin@@ arily the O@@ ra@@ cle of Del@@ ph@@ i on interest @-@ rate matters , has declared the current situation &quot; a con@@ und@@ rum . &quot;
history suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out , with US productivity gains likely to radi@@ ate out across the world , raising growth rates everywhere .
ordin@@ arily , rapid global growth trans@@ l@@ ates into high long @-@ term interest rates - that is , unless , deep down , people have become ner@@ v@@ ous .
sup@@ pose investors are wor@@ ried about a small chance of c@@ atastrophe over the next five to ten years .
( according to experts on nuclear terrorism and pan@@ demi@@ cs , the dang@@ ers are real . )
sup@@ pose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong , but that may@@ be - just may@@ be - things will fall ap@@ art .
in this case , it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co @-@ exist with strong growth .
true , some economists point to the hal@@ cy@@ on days of the 19@@ 50 &quot; s and early 19@@ 60 &quot; s , when Europe , the US , and Japan prosp@@ ered , but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth .
since that was a g@@ ol@@ den era for global growth , why worry if we are se@@ eing the same phen@@ om@@ en@@ on today ?
what the optimi@@ sts for@@ get is that the 19@@ 50 &quot; s and 19@@ 60 &quot; s were also a period of massive in@@ security .
many people reali@@ sti@@ cally fe@@ ared the out@@ break of World War I@@ II - and with good reason , according to many histori@@ ans .
back then , the spec@@ ter of the A@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ se helped keep borrowing che@@ ap .
hap@@ pi@@ ly , investors &quot; d@@ ark@@ est fears were not reali@@ zed , and we can only hope for the same .
but if in@@ security is a major under@@ current of today &apos;s record @-@ low interest rates , then G @-@ 8 leaders should be more cau@@ tious in their self @-@ con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ation .
investors &quot; collective psych@@ ology is not@@ ori@@ ously fragi@@ le .
if they ever cal@@ m down , interest rates will sho@@ ot up , and that could well bring the global economy &apos;s si@@ mm@@ ering imbalances to a ra@@ ging bo@@ il .
the E@@ duc@@ ation My@@ th
we all know that more education is a Go@@ od Th@@ ing , especially for our economic fu@@ tures .
this is why many countries , particularly in Europe , have num@@ eri@@ cal targets driving their education policies : 50 % participation in post @-@ sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y education in the UK or S@@ weden , for example , or 80 % to b@@ acc@@ al@@ au@@ re@@ ate level in France .
Chanc@@ ellor Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der &apos;s big idea for sol@@ ving Germany &apos;s economic problems is , of course , education : including yet more under@@ gradu@@ ates in a system strugg@@ ling to co@@ pe with those it has . &amp; # 160 ;
governments see their main job as deli@@ vering economic prosperity , and they view education as a necessary and reli@@ able to@@ ol for achieving that end .
but is it ?
we are told that in a &quot; knowledge economy , &quot; a country needs ever more gradu@@ ates and formal quali@@ fic@@ ations to sta@@ y competitive .
but education simply does not deliver economic growth the way our politicians - and busin@@ ess@@ men - believe : more education in does not mean more growth out .
worse , the education policies that follow from current belie@@ fs have serious negative consequences for opportunities for young people and the quality of education itself .
the argument that education matters for the economy is plau@@ sible because , at one level , it is ob@@ viously right .
a modern society does need educ@@ ated people : not just engine@@ ers , chemi@@ sts , and doc@@ tors , but millions of people who can wri@@ te co@@ her@@ ent let@@ ters , fi@@ ll in complic@@ ated forms , explain insurance policies , and interpre@@ t statisti@@ cal data from mach@@ ines on fac@@ tory flo@@ ors .
some of these skills can be learned only in universities ; others can ( and should ) be ma@@ ster@@ ed in primary and sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y schools .
employ@@ ers nat@@ ur@@ ally tend to hi@@ re the most educ@@ ated workers on offer , and so as the number of gradu@@ ates increase , so does the number of &quot; gradu@@ ate &quot; jobs .
however , every study I know of - whether British , S@@ c@@ and@@ in@@ avi@@ an , or American - agre@@ es that large numbers of these &quot; gradu@@ ate &quot; jobs require no more than they did when non @-@ gradu@@ ates per@@ formed them perf@@ ec@@ tly well .
in this sense , many societies are already &quot; over @-@ educ@@ ated . &quot;
but perhaps this is ir@@ relevant .
may@@ be better @-@ educ@@ ated workers do their jobs more effici@@ ently , in which case we will surely find a clear relationship between educ@@ ational at@@ tain@@ ment and economic growth .
al@@ as , no .
a few recently industri@@ alized countries have pursu@@ ed successful government @-@ driven education strategies that seem to boost economic development .
but for every such case - South Korea is the favor@@ i@@ te example - there is another , like Hong Kong , where met@@ e@@ ori@@ c economic growth had nothing to do with cent@@ r@@ ally plann@@ ed education policy .
instead , par@@ ents push@@ ed their children towards the best schools to give them an individual head start - something par@@ ents do the world over - only after they go@@ t rich@@ er .
moreover , for every South Korea , and every Hong Kong , we can also find developing countries where exp@@ anding education merely fu@@ eled competition for whi@@ te @-@ c@@ ollar jobs in a blo@@ ated , de@@ ad@@ weight state bureau@@ cracy .
countries like this explain why large international studies often find a negative relationship between education and growth rates .
Egypt is a classi@@ c example of this . between 1970 and 1998 , its primary school en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment rates gre@@ w to over 90 % , sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y scho@@ ol@@ ing so@@ ared from 3@@ 2 % to 75 % , and universi@@ ty education doub@@ led .
Egypt started the period as the world &apos;s 4@@ 7@@ th poorest country ; it ended the period as the 4@@ 8@@ th poorest .
but it is not only among developing countries that lin@@ ks between education and growth prove el@@ u@@ sive .
S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land has been one of the rich@@ est countries in the world for a century - and not because of its natural resources .
yet it has the low@@ est rate of universi@@ ty atten@@ d@@ ance in Western Europe .
if you look for a relationship between children &apos;s performance on international sur@@ ve@@ ys of achie@@ vement , and their countries &quot; growth rates twenty years on , you will look in v@@ ain .
no such relationship exi@@ sts .
so , while any developed country ob@@ viously needs an educ@@ ated population , the idea that having the most education will get you the most prosperity is a ch@@ im@@ era .
does this matter , though ?
surely , education has other vir@@ tu@@ es , over and above its economic role .
so may@@ be we should stop criti@@ ci@@ zing and start cele@@ br@@ ating governments &quot; enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m for spending on education .
but this would ignor@@ e the dar@@ k under@@ side of our educ@@ ational spi@@ ral .
the creation of more &quot; gradu@@ ate &quot; jobs only pro@@ ves that as cre@@ denti@@ als become more common , they become more important .
moreover , in the past , some@@ one who left school without the &quot; right &quot; quali@@ fic@@ ations could still succeed , through an app@@ ren@@ ti@@ c@@ es@@ hi@@ p or by working his way up from the sho@@ p flo@@ or .
today , that is becoming impossible : we are creating societies in which the she@@ ep and the go@@ ats are mark@@ ed for life in their te@@ ens .
as universi@@ ty atten@@ d@@ ance becomes more common , fewer cap@@ able young people enter voc@@ ational training .
yet our economies still need highly tra@@ ined cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople far more than another bat@@ ch of ar@@ ts gradu@@ ates .
moreover , rapid expansion of universi@@ ty education all too often comes at the expen@@ se of quality .
education is expensive because it uses people : there are no vast economies of scale or le@@ aps in productivity .
relative pay for te@@ ach@@ ers has been dro@@ pp@@ ing as their total numbers increase , which aff@@ ects te@@ acher quality .
University cl@@ asses become larger , which means that students are tau@@ ght less effectively .
it becomes har@@ der to maintain good universi@@ ty @-@ based research because of the demands of other parts of the education budget . &amp; # 160 ;
is this really the best rou@@ te to a vi@@ br@@ ant economy and a civili@@ zed , cul@@ tured , and open society ?
Re@@ ef@@ er Mad@@ ness ?
London - I@@ s c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is harm@@ ful to mental health ?
that question has provo@@ ked much debate over the years , often gener@@ ating more he@@ at than light .
the bottom line is this : within the scientific community , there is a general consensus that most people who use c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is will not develop significant mental @-@ health problems .
certain individuals , however , are more sus@@ c@@ epti@@ ble to the negative effects of its use .
it was long thought that c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is was a relatively harm@@ less drug , and that concerns about its use were over@@ st@@ ated .
some psych@@ i@@ atri@@ sts had repor@@ ted that excessive use could lead to a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic state , including h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ations , del@@ u@@ sions , and thought dist@@ ur@@ b@@ ance .
but the first significant indic@@ ation of a lin@@ k between c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic ill@@ ness came only in 198@@ 7 , from a large S@@ we@@ dis@@ h study that followed more than 5@@ 0,000 sub@@ jects over 15 years .
repor@@ ted c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use at the study &apos;s start increased the like@@ li@@ hood of being diagno@@ sed with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia in the next 15 years .
the greater the use , the higher the like@@ li@@ hood of being diagno@@ sed .
c@@ uri@@ ously , this fin@@ ding did not sp@@ ur much interest , and no similar studies were repor@@ ted until 2002 .
since then , however , many studies have explo@@ red the associ@@ ation between c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic ill@@ ness .
in 2007 , a comp@@ il@@ ation of the best studies conclu@@ ded that frequ@@ ent ( da@@ i@@ ly ) c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use doub@@ les the risk of a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic outcome .
since the li@@ fe@@ time pre@@ val@@ ence of a p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic ill@@ ness is roughly 1 % of the population , da@@ i@@ ly c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use would increase this to 2 % .
of course , the exist@@ ence of a positive cor@@ rel@@ ation between c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis does not allow us to dra@@ w a direct caus@@ al lin@@ k between the two .
p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis could cause c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use , rather than vice vers@@ a , or an un@@ known medi@@ ating factor could cause both c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis .
other factors already complic@@ ate the relationship .
for example , the age at which c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use beg@@ ins appears to be an important factor .
people who started using c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is before the age of 16 have a higher risk of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis compared to those who start after 18 .
this is in line with bi@@ ological evidence suggest@@ ing that the mat@@ uring bra@@ in is more sus@@ c@@ epti@@ ble to the negative impact of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is .
recent research has shown that a particular vari@@ ant of a gene called A@@ K@@ T@@ 1 medi@@ ates the risk of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis .
for car@@ ri@@ ers of the C / C vari@@ ant ( which occur@@ s in roughly 20 % of the population ) , the risk of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis increased seven @-@ fol@@ d - but only for the people who used c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is every day .
using c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is on we@@ ek@@ ends or less often posed no increased risk , which was also the case for da@@ i@@ ly and we@@ ek@@ end use among car@@ ri@@ ers of the C / T and T / T vari@@ ants of A@@ K@@ T@@ 1 .
moreover , different stra@@ ins of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is pose more or less risk for p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis .
a compar@@ is@@ on of the two most common typ@@ es of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is in the United Kingdom , h@@ as@@ h and sin@@ se@@ mi@@ ll@@ a ( &quot; sk@@ un@@ k &quot; ) , found that using sk@@ un@@ k imp@@ lied a significantly greater risk of p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis , while h@@ as@@ h did not .
the explan@@ ation for this difference lies in the com@@ position of the two main comp@@ onents of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is , d@@ elt@@ a @-@ 9 @-@ tet@@ ra@@ hy@@ dro@@ c@@ ann@@ ab@@ in@@ ol ( T@@ H@@ C ) and c@@ ann@@ abi@@ di@@ ol ( C@@ B@@ D ) .
S@@ kun@@ k in the UK has high levels of T@@ H@@ C while being virtually de@@ vo@@ id of C@@ B@@ D ; h@@ as@@ h , on the other hand , has roughly equal quanti@@ ties of the two comp@@ onents .
this was high@@ ligh@@ ted in our la@@ b when healthy vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers were given either p@@ ure T@@ H@@ C or T@@ H@@ C and C@@ B@@ D . those who received only T@@ H@@ C had a significant increase in par@@ an@@ o@@ id th@@ ou@@ ghts , p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s , and mem@@ ory im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , while those who received the combination experienced no par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , had fewer p@@ sy@@ cho@@ tic sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s , and main@@ tained mem@@ ory func@@ tion .
some studies have also explo@@ red the role of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use in dis@@ or@@ ders such as de@@ pression and an@@ xi@@ ety .
while little sign of a lin@@ k has been found , there is better evidence for the ad@@ dic@@ tive potential of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is .
roughly 10 % of people who smo@@ ke c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is go on to develop dependence , which produ@@ ces withdra@@ w@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s when use is stopp@@ ed , such as cra@@ ving , ir@@ rit@@ ability , sle@@ ep dist@@ ur@@ ban@@ ces , ab@@ domin@@ al pain , and ner@@ v@@ ous@@ ness .
again , C@@ B@@ D seems to off@@ set the ad@@ dic@@ tive effects of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is , and seems to provide relief from withdra@@ w@@ al sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ s .
many studies have focused on the possible negative impact of c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use on mem@@ ory and other co@@ gni@@ tive func@@ tions .
it is generally accepted that frequ@@ ent and pro@@ long@@ ed c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use im@@ pa@@ ir@@ s co@@ gni@@ tive func@@ tioning , but that these effects are rever@@ sible following ab@@ stin@@ ence of 3 @-@ 12 months .
however , a recent study that followed people from bir@@ th to age 3@@ 8 found that those who started using c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is early , every day , and for several years had a permanent 8 @-@ point drop in I@@ Q sco@@ res .
( the study has not yet been rep@@ lic@@ ated . )
a final , and often @-@ over@@ loo@@ ked , source of har@@ m to mental health associated with c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is is the legal fall@@ out of being cau@@ ght with it .
pen@@ al@@ ties for c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is pos@@ s@@ ession range from none ( for example , the Ne@@ ther@@ lands and Portugal ) to legal war@@ nings , fin@@ es , and even life im@@ prison@@ ment ( Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia ) .
a crimin@@ al record can neg@@ ati@@ vely aff@@ ect future employment , education , and ability to tra@@ v@@ el .
such consequences may carry independent risks to mental health ; for example , unemployment poses a significant risk for su@@ i@@ cide , an@@ xi@@ ety , de@@ pression , and p@@ sy@@ cho@@ sis .
so , does c@@ ann@@ ab@@ is use har@@ m mental health ?
yes and no .
much depends on how old you are when you start , your gen@@ es , and how much , how often , and what kind you use - and , of course , on whether you get cau@@ ght .
the Egyp@@ tian cru@@ ci@@ ble
Mad@@ rid - A@@ s Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ten@@ sely a@@ wa@@ ited the results of their country &apos;s presidential elections , a thre@@ ad of p@@ essi@@ mism r@@ an through the dis@@ course of the young people and secular liber@@ als who had brought down Ho@@ s@@ ni Mubarak in January 2011 .
the &quot; anything is possible &quot; sen@@ s@@ ation of the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are re@@ bel@@ li@@ on had f@@ ad@@ ed , and now two candidates whom the prote@@ sters deeply op@@ posed , the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood &apos;s Moh@@ am@@ ed Mor@@ si , and Ah@@ med S@@ haf@@ i@@ q , a fac@@ tot@@ um of the old regime ( and of the current military government ) , prepared to face off in the second round .
the tri@@ ad of fundamental forces driving Egypt since the beginning of the Arab Spr@@ ing - the military , the mo@@ s@@ que , and the m@@ asses in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , each with different typ@@ es of power and interests - was thus bro@@ ken .
those who fi@@ lled T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are 16 months ago were si@@ len@@ ced , and the expected transfer of power from the military to a civilian , democratic government was thro@@ wn into doubt .
since assum@@ ing power after Mubarak &apos;s fall , the Su@@ pre@@ me Council of the Ar@@ med For@@ ces ( S@@ C@@ A@@ F ) , led by Fi@@ eld Mar@@ sh@@ al Moh@@ am@@ ed Hussein T@@ anta@@ w@@ i , a defense minister for two decades under Mubarak , has consist@@ ently undermin@@ ed the de@@ lic@@ ate work of democratic transition .
the week before the presidential elections , the S@@ C@@ A@@ F @-@ al@@ lied Constitu@@ tional Court dis@@ sol@@ ved the recently elected parliament , al@@ leg@@ ing il@@ leg@@ ality in the vot@@ ing process .
and , fo@@ rese@@ eing Mor@@ si &apos;s victory , S@@ C@@ A@@ F assum@@ ed all legisl@@ ative powers ; sever@@ ely limited the president &apos;s powers ; sei@@ zed the authority to ap@@ point the commit@@ tee t@@ asked with dra@@ f@@ ting the new Constitu@@ tion ; took control of the country &apos;s budget ; and claim@@ ed sol@@ e power over domestic and foreign security .
as a result , Egypt &apos;s power struggle will continue , with the jun@@ ta no longer batt@@ ling those in T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r S@@ qu@@ are , but political Islam .
after a decades @-@ long c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine ( although toler@@ ated ) exist@@ ence within Egyp@@ tian society , Islamist forces were able to take advantage of the T@@ ah@@ ri@@ r protests , despite playing no inte@@ gra@@ l part in them .
the secular liberal forces &quot; political frag@@ ment@@ ation and lack of organization cost them de@@ arly in the parliamentary elections six months ago , and , in the second round of the presidential election , a majority of Egyp@@ ti@@ ans ch@@ ose Mor@@ si over a rest@@ or@@ ation of the old regime .
but Mor@@ si &apos;s nar@@ row mar@@ gin of victory ( just 3.@@ 5 percentage points ) over S@@ haf@@ i@@ q , and low vot@@ er tur@@ n@@ out - 4@@ 6@@ .@@ 4 % in the first round and 5@@ 1.@@ 8 % in the second - reflect a pol@@ ari@@ zed , ex@@ hau@@ sted society that l@@ acks confidence in the electoral process and the candidates .
moreover , the outcome has merely fu@@ eled further uncertainty about Egypt &apos;s direction .
with Mor@@ si &apos;s victory , some now fear that the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood will seek to implement radical policies aimed at Islami@@ zing a Muslim country that is already conservative , but that has had a secular government for decades .
others do not believe that the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood will go so far , but nonetheless doubt that the Bro@@ thers will def@@ end a secular , truly democratic regime in the ongoing negotiations with S@@ C@@ A@@ F on a transition to civilian rule .
in either scenario , Mor@@ si has little room to man@@ eu@@ ver in a country that , for the time being , is in political lim@@ b@@ o - with neither a constitution nor a parliament - and whose people want tan@@ gi@@ ble results in terms of good governance , institutional consolid@@ ation , and impro@@ vements to a tot@@ ter@@ ing economy .
indeed , living standards have been under severe pressure since Mubarak &apos;s down@@ fall .
in 2011 alone , net capital inf@@ lows fell nearly 90 % year on year , tou@@ ris@@ m was down 30 % , the trade deficit so@@ ared to $ 28 billion , and GDP growth slow@@ ed from 3.@@ 8 % to 1 % .
the success or failure of Mor@@ si &apos;s government will rest largely on the economy .
for the Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood , this scenario constitu@@ tes a serious challenge , one that can be overcome only by fin@@ ding an adequate balance between S@@ C@@ A@@ F , with its over@@ we@@ ening power , and Egypt &apos;s liberal political forces - which won a combined 11 million vot@@ es , five million more than Mor@@ si , in the presidential election &apos;s first round .
only this will give a Mor@@ si administration the necessary legitimacy and capacity to carry out a jo@@ int transition with the military for a true change of regime .
the liber@@ als , for their part , did not support Mor@@ si in the run @-@ off with S@@ haf@@ i@@ q .
but it was their efforts that made the presidential election possible in the first place , and many now believe that close coll@@ abor@@ ation with the Bro@@ thers is the only available option that can restore some of the spiri@@ t of an end@@ ang@@ ered revolution in which they were the pro@@ ta@@ g@@ oni@@ sts .
this pre@@ sup@@ poses that the Bro@@ thers re@@ organi@@ ze themselves intern@@ ally and find ways to dist@@ ance themselves from more radical fac@@ tions , and that they promote inclu@@ sive policies toward vulnerable groups and social min@@ orities .
for now , the Bro@@ thers have announced that they will name a Christi@@ an and a wom@@ an as Vi@@ ce Pre@@ sidents .
ob@@ viously , that represents an encoura@@ ging first step in bri@@ d@@ ging Egypt &apos;s divi@@ des .
but , just as ob@@ viously , it is only a first step .
the Egyp@@ tian En@@ d@@ game
Princeton - C@@ an Egypt &apos;s long history help us to understand the u@@ pri@@ sing , already lab@@ eled a revolution , now under@@ way in C@@ air@@ o , and how it might turn out ?
I believe so .
after all , the demon@@ stra@@ tions by millions of people to demand an end to the rule of President Ho@@ s@@ ni Mubarak and his National Democratic Party ( N@@ DP ) are not an unprecedented phen@@ om@@ en@@ on in the country .
Egypt &apos;s history is re@@ ple@@ te with powerful and fam@@ ous ru@@ lers ( starting with R@@ am@@ ses II in P@@ har@@ a@@ oni@@ c times , and including Sal@@ adi@@ n , Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d Al@@ i , Na@@ po@@ le@@ on B@@ on@@ ap@@ ar@@ te , L@@ or@@ d C@@ ro@@ mer , all the way up to the Egyp@@ tian military tri@@ o of G@@ am@@ al Ab@@ del N@@ asser , An@@ war E@@ l Sad@@ at , and Mubarak ) .
this suggests that , although Egyp@@ ti@@ ans may not necessarily pre@@ fer strong@@ man rule , they are entirely com@@ fort@@ able with it and may even believe that it is necessary .
to be sure , popular re@@ vol@@ ts are nothing new for Egypt .
crow@@ ds ro@@ se against Na@@ po@@ le@@ on &apos;s French forces in 17@@ 9@@ 8 , against the mon@@ arch@@ y in 18@@ 8@@ 1 @-@ 18@@ 8@@ 2 , against British domin@@ ance in 19@@ 19 and 195@@ 2 , against Sad@@ at in 197@@ 7 , and against Mubarak in 198@@ 6 .
these u@@ pri@@ sin@@ gs were repres@@ sed , often bru@@ t@@ ally , first by foreign troops ( the French army in 17@@ 9@@ 8 and British soldi@@ ers in 18@@ 8@@ 2 and 19@@ 19 ) and more recently by the Egyp@@ tian army .
unfortunately , while an@@ gr@@ y prote@@ sters have sometimes forced un@@ wel@@ come ru@@ lers out of power , they have been unable to re@@ place ty@@ r@@ ants with governments that respect the public &apos;s wi@@ sh@@ es .
will this long history of authoritarian rule now be bro@@ ken ?
the first days of the current u@@ pri@@ sing fa@@ vo@@ red the people .
the crow@@ ds were enormous and peaceful , not only in C@@ air@@ o , the histori@@ c no@@ de for prot@@ est , but in all of Egypt &apos;s cities .
in addition , the army , called out o@@ sten@@ sibly to restore order , held back , a mark@@ edly different response from its repres@@ sion of past u@@ pri@@ sin@@ gs .
French and British soldi@@ ers did not he@@ si@@ t@@ ate to put down resistance . nor did the Egyp@@ tian army in 195@@ 2 , 197@@ 7 , and 198@@ 6 .
the u@@ pri@@ sing in 195@@ 2 is particularly reve@@ aling , because it was widespread and inten@@ sely popular , for it was direc@@ ted against the much @-@ h@@ ated British .
although the British had 10@@ 0,000 troops st@@ ation@@ ed near the Su@@ e@@ z Can@@ al at the time , they ch@@ ose not to interven@@ e .
instead , it was the small and highly profession@@ al Egyp@@ tian army that c@@ rus@@ h@@ ed the u@@ pri@@ sing , to the dis@@ may of the young of@@ fic@@ er cor@@ ps , who were already well advanced in their plans to sei@@ ze power .
years of fighting in Arab @-@ Israeli conflicts , however , trans@@ formed the army , giving rise to a massive con@@ s@@ cri@@ p@@ t force that tot@@ als appro@@ xim@@ ately 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 soldi@@ ers today .
the army &apos;s lower rank@@ s are now fi@@ lled with young men , dra@@ wn from all se@@ g@@ ments of Egyp@@ tian society , whose back@@ gro@@ unds are no different from those of the people they may be called upon to sup@@ press .
today &apos;s Egyp@@ tian army is a people &apos;s army , and , unlike the revi@@ led security forces , it is widely ad@@ mi@@ red .
senior of@@ fic@@ ers surely know the risks that they will inc@@ ur if they order these men to fire on fri@@ ends and relati@@ ves .
moreover , the current mass demon@@ stra@@ tions are radi@@ cally different from previous prot@@ est movements that the army sup@@ pressed .
in 197@@ 7 , many ro@@ se to op@@ pose an end to food and other consumer subsidies ; in 198@@ 6 , poor@@ ly paid security forces went on a ra@@ m@@ pa@@ ge .
the numbers involved in those protests were min@@ is@@ cu@@ le compared to now .
nor were the prote@@ sters &quot; actions peaceful .
they threat@@ ened property and undermin@@ ed political order from the out@@ set .
the Egyp@@ tian high comm@@ and did not need to worry that r@@ ank @-@ and @-@ fi@@ le soldi@@ ers would di@@ so@@ be@@ y or@@ ders , because they were protec@@ ting the citi@@ zen@@ ry .
yet , the current prot@@ est , which started so peac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly and with such e@@ bul@@ li@@ ence , took a dramatic and violent turn several days ago .
Mubarak &apos;s promise that he would not run for re @-@ election this coming September , which might have m@@ ol@@ li@@ fied his critics two weeks earlier , was no longer enough .
when this conc@@ ession failed , Mubarak and the ruling N@@ DP began to work behind the scen@@ es , encoura@@ ging their fol@@ lo@@ wers to attack prote@@ sters and provo@@ ke violence .
but Mubarak has also prepared the way for a new set of leaders - all strong@@ ly committed to the old order .
almost all of them are high @-@ rank@@ ing military of@@ fic@@ ers , now el@@ ev@@ ated to the government &apos;s most important offi@@ ces .
gener@@ als now hold the positions of Vi@@ ce @-@ President , Prime Minister , D@@ ep@@ ut@@ y Prime Minister , Minister of Def@@ ense , and Minister of the Inter@@ ior .
nor are the anti @-@ government prote@@ sters likely to find robu@@ st support from the United States , always deeply involved in Egyp@@ tian affairs , regardless of how often President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasi@@ ze America &apos;s commitment to freedom and democracy .
yes , the Americans want Mubarak to leave - and quickly .
but the an@@ ch@@ or of US policy in the Middle East is the Egyp@@ tian @-@ Israeli peace treaty , negoti@@ ated by Sad@@ at in 197@@ 9 , main@@ tained by Mubarak , and well lik@@ ed by Egypt &apos;s military high comm@@ and , which controls the strong@@ est Arab army , is US @-@ tra@@ ined , and has been supp@@ lied with top @-@ sh@@ el@@ f American weap@@ on@@ ry .
a popular government in which the Islamist Muslim Bro@@ ther@@ hood is repres@@ ented would worry the Americans and the Egyp@@ tian military , owing to the prospect that it would re@@ pu@@ di@@ ate the peace treaty with Israel and je@@ op@@ ar@@ di@@ ze relations with the US .
but that is not the most immediate concern .
should violence increase , ordinary soldi@@ ers would likely once again feel du@@ ty @-@ bound to interven@@ e to restore order and prevent further b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed .
if not , the prospects for a transition to a government formed by leaders of the much @-@ resp@@ ected Egyp@@ tian army and moder@@ ates repres@@ enting business and political elites seem high .
the ei@@ gh@@ te@@ enth Bru@@ ma@@ ire of Ar@@ n@@ old Sch@@ war@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger
re@@ plac@@ ing a govern@@ or whom they re @-@ elected only a year before with Ar@@ n@@ old Sch@@ war@@ zen@@ eg@@ ger must have given C@@ aliforni@@ an voters an enorm@@ ous@@ --@@ if gu@@ il@@ ty@@ --@@ ple@@ as@@ ure .
some members of the opposition in Germany would de@@ arly lo@@ ve to do the same to Chanc@@ ellor Ger@@ hard Sch@@ rö@@ der , though they have not ( yet ! ) found a fil@@ m st@@ ar to re@@ place him .
several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of un@@ popul@@ ar@@ ity not long after being elected .
beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acc@@ la@@ im@@ ed Brazi@@ lian President Lu@@ is In@@ aci@@ o &quot; L@@ ula &quot; da S@@ il@@ va , to say nothing of Mexi@@ can President Vi@@ c@@ ente Fo@@ x and South Korean President Ro@@ h Mo@@ o @-@ hy@@ un , the lat@@ ter having called for a referendum to help ar@@ rest his sin@@ king popul@@ ar@@ ity .
electoral success , it appears , fa@@ des fast nowadays .
so should every country adopt a rec@@ all proce@@ dur@@ e to maintain the legitimacy of governments ?
absol@@ ut@@ ely not .
democracy , in the words of the philosop@@ her Kar@@ l Pop@@ per , is about being able to re@@ move those in power without violence ; it is in this sense about tri@@ al and er@@ ror .
but leaders must be given the chance to go@@ ver@@ n .
indeed , they need a chance to make mistak@@ es and to learn and reco@@ ver from their err@@ ors , as long as their decisions do not aff@@ ect the found@@ ations of the democratic order itself .
tri@@ al and er@@ ror implies the opportunity to er@@ r before we try again .
C@@ aliforni@@ an voters &apos; first mistake is thus what may be called &quot; the l@@ ure of the immediate &quot; --@@ none too surpri@@ sing in a state where inst@@ ant gra@@ ti@@ fication is sup@@ pos@@ edly a core value .
but sometimes this desire seems overwhel@@ ming in post @-@ modern democracies everywhere .
indeed , democracy nowadays has embra@@ ced a po@@ p culture of rapidly pass@@ ing f@@ ads ; today &apos;s hy@@ st@@ eri@@ a @-@ gener@@ ating po@@ p group is for@@ got@@ ten tom@@ or@@ row , and there are always more wa@@ iting in the w@@ ings .
in politics this can be dangerous , because it encoura@@ ges bas@@ ing decisions , no matter how wei@@ gh@@ ty , on whatever popular opinion moment@@ arily prev@@ ails .
the call for more refer@@ en@@ da both reflects and fuels this trend .
refer@@ en@@ da are for the most part s@@ n@@ ap@@ sh@@ ots .
S@@ wi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , with its generally s@@ lower pace and its th@@ or@@ ough political deb@@ ates before vot@@ es are held , may be the exc@@ eption .
as a rule however , refer@@ en@@ da measure the popul@@ ar@@ ity of political leaders at a particular moment , regardless of the issue at stak@@ e .
if and when Britain vot@@ es on jo@@ ining the Euro , the result will most likely tell us all sor@@ ts of things about T@@ ony Blair and about the European Union , but little about the mer@@ its of the common currency .
so the case for represent@@ ative government remains strong .
democracy is government by debate , by taking important decisions after th@@ or@@ ough de@@ liber@@ ation of the kind th@@ at@@ --@@ at least in large coun@@ tri@@ es@@ --@@ must be conduc@@ ted in a parliament through elected represent@@ atives .
sometimes parli@@ am@@ ents wish to act quickly , and perhaps must do so , but as a rule they take enough time to exam@@ ine issues fully .
parli@@ am@@ ents talk before reaching conclu@@ sions ; h@@ ence their name .
consider Germany , where some leaders of the opposition Christi@@ an Democrats ye@@ ar@@ n to sin@@ k the Sch@@ rö@@ der government .
clearly , the reforms proposed and already partly en@@ acted by the government are un@@ popular , and there is little doubt that , a year after their re @-@ election , the coalition of the So@@ cial Democrats and the Gre@@ ens would not stand much of a chance at the poll@@ s .
but who knows what the elector@@ ate will think in three years , at the end of the government &apos;s full term in office ?
by the time of the next regul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed election , it could become clear that there were no real altern@@ atives to Sch@@ rö@@ der &apos;s policies , and it could even be the case that the predic@@ ted bene@@ fi@@ cial effects of pain@@ ful reforms will become appar@@ ent by then .
leadership needs time to take and implement un@@ popular decisions as well as popular ones .
leaders themselves need the ner@@ ve to take often prec@@ ari@@ ous parliamentary maj@@ orities through the trou@@ gh@@ s of popul@@ ar@@ ity .
this is why they should com@@ mit their cru@@ el@@ est de@@ e@@ ds in the first year and so@@ ften up as the next election appro@@ aches .
the un@@ easy partner@@ ship of Prime Minister T@@ ony Blair and Chanc@@ ellor of the Ex@@ ch@@ equ@@ er G@@ ord@@ on Bro@@ wn is a good example of this tac@@ tic .
leaders who never risk their popul@@ ar@@ ity are not worth their position .
so C@@ aliforni@@ a has set a bad example , and C@@ aliforni@@ ans will probably pay a heavy price for it .
they may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago , when the popul@@ arly elected L@@ ou@@ is Na@@ po@@ le@@ on trans@@ formed himself , via a wi@@ l@@ dly popular referendum , into Na@@ po@@ le@@ on I@@ I@@ I@@ --@@ that vote being the last the French would enjo@@ y until the end of the Sec@@ ond Emp@@ ire .
C@@ aliforni@@ ans , of course , won &apos;t be di@@ sen@@ fr@@ an@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , but their will@@ ful@@ ness threat@@ ens to yi@@ eld a wa@@ y@@ ward and ir@@ responsible form of state politics .
to be sure , democracy implies li@@ mit@@ ing the time that the powerful have to exerci@@ se their power without challenge .
an effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legisl@@ ate and to carry out their program .
these two im@@ per@@ atives are inher@@ ently contra@@ dic@@ tory , but the balance between them is still best achieved through represent@@ ative , parliamentary democracy .
anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week &apos;s top ten po@@ p son@@ gs .

the E@@ lec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c Mon@@ ey Revolution
most journali@@ stic accounts of the new forms of elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money mis@@ le@@ ad@@ ingly sp@@ in the story as the emer@@ gence of yet another conven@@ i@@ ence for the technologi@@ cally p@@ am@@ per@@ ed .
so what if we can pul@@ l out a &quot; sm@@ art car@@ d &quot; rather than carry co@@ ins ?
big deal .
these new forms of money sound like power win@@ do@@ ws on c@@ ars , or remo@@ te control for T@@ V s@@ ets .
may@@ be we &apos;@@ d be better off without these g@@ ad@@ gets .
but media co@@ verage has failed to look far enough into the future , and to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end the full extent of the changes that will be w@@ rought by new forms of elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money , as people and businesses inv@@ ent new ways of doing business .
elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money is not a chan@@ ne@@ l chan@@ ger : as it develop@@ s , it will help trans@@ form the world economy .
two benefits of elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money stand out , and will likely contribute to its growth . most important , it will have pro@@ found intellectual benefits by creating incentives for the active pursu@@ it of ideas .
second , elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money will advance globalization , exp@@ anding the sco@@ pe and vers@@ ati@@ lity of the Internet and making it easier for people to inter@@ act con@@ struc@@ tively with others around the world .
taken together , these two benefits will enable millions of min@@ ds to work together far more effectively than ever before .
to understand elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money &apos;s potential signific@@ ance , consider the inv@@ en@@ tion of co@@ ins , the first form of true money , in L@@ y@@ di@@ a ( now Turkey ) in the se@@ v@@ enth century B@@ C and , indepen@@ d@@ ently , in China .
this was an important advance , and thus one that spread quickly .
the reason is stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward . before the inv@@ en@@ tion of co@@ ins , commer@@ ce depen@@ ded on preci@@ ous met@@ als .
but the amounts had to be cut to the size of the trans@@ action and wei@@ gh@@ ed out with balance sc@@ ales .
people had to carry the sc@@ ales , ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ying wei@@ ghts , and sometimes even tools to cut the met@@ al , just to be able to trans@@ act .
Ar@@ che@@ ologi@@ sts still find el@@ abor@@ ate ( and probably expensive in those days ) two @-@ p@@ an balance sc@@ ales and wei@@ ghts on sun@@ ken br@@ on@@ ze @-@ age mer@@ ch@@ ant ships .
most people did@@ n &apos;t have them .
another difficul@@ ty with using un@@ differ@@ enti@@ ated preci@@ ous met@@ als for exchange was that some trust or exper@@ ti@@ se was required to ass@@ ure people that the met@@ al was p@@ ure .
the same problem occurred with other commodi@@ ties that people tried to use for exchange , such as ge@@ ms or sh@@ ells ; their value was too un@@ certain .
as a result of these obstac@@ les , it was hard to carry out small trans@@ actions before the inv@@ en@@ tion of stand@@ ar@@ di@@ zed and identi@@ cal co@@ ins , and trade must have been largely con@@ fin@@ ed to big de@@ als between major parties .
with the introduc@@ tion of co@@ ins , it became possible to develop many new kin@@ ds of business .
one could easily establish and operate a business s@@ elling food by the ser@@ ving or providing small household it@@ ems to anyone who happened to p@@ ass by .
but , most import@@ antly , the inv@@ en@@ tion of co@@ ins great@@ ly enh@@ anced the spread of knowledge . after the inv@@ en@@ tion of co@@ ins , it became easy to sell boo@@ ks , lessons , and in@@ struc@@ tions .
the development of co@@ ins is part of the reason that both the classi@@ cal world around an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ a and China in the H@@ an D@@ yn@@ ast@@ y were so advanced compared to other parts of the world .
the lesson is that the ma@@ gn@@ it@@ u@@ de of trans@@ action costs and contrac@@ ting costs ultimately determine much of an economy &apos;s structure .
as new forms of money reduce these costs , the rich@@ ness and comple@@ x@@ ity of our economy will be increased .
lower trans@@ action costs mean that exchange can be dramatically more fin@@ e @-@ gra@@ ined .
with the latest forms of elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money we can sell millions of little things , to millions of different people all over the world .
no@@ where is this more important than in the re@@ al@@ m of ideas .
credit car@@ d companies now ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely char@@ ge the firms accep@@ ting credit car@@ d payments US $ 0.@@ 25 plus between two and three perc@@ ent of the amount trans@@ fer@@ red per pay@@ ment .
this fe@@ e structure makes it difficult to run a business s@@ elling it@@ ems for less than ten dollars , and impossible to run a business s@@ elling it@@ ems for less than one dollar : trans@@ action costs e@@ at up the profits .
through sup@@ eri@@ or payments so@@ ft@@ w@@ are , mi@@ cro@@ payments companies like P@@ ay@@ P@@ al ( found@@ ed in 1998 ) , Y@@ ag@@ a ( found@@ ed in 2000 ) , P@@ ep@@ per@@ co@@ in ( found@@ ed in 2001 ) and B@@ it@@ P@@ ass ( found@@ ed in 2002 ) are able to offer much lower trans@@ action costs than credit car@@ d companies , great@@ ly exp@@ anding the number of trans@@ actions .
a company can now char@@ ge people less than a dollar for a service ( such as vie@@ wing a we@@ b pa@@ ge ) , and get significant returns by high vol@@ ume .
there are skepti@@ cs who say that the public is resist@@ ant to bu@@ ying digit@@ al con@@ tent , because people are acc@@ u@@ st@@ om@@ ed to getting it for free .
that is what people used to say years ago about c@@ able T@@ V .
exc@@ ell@@ ent T@@ V progra@@ mm@@ ing is not given away for free . neither are other substantial intellectual cre@@ ations .
these skepti@@ cs over@@ look the pro@@ found changes that new technologies gradu@@ ally make in our hab@@ its as we disco@@ ver their pos@@ sibi@@ lities .
already , we have seen the success of App@@ le &apos;s i@@ T@@ un@@ es , which s@@ ells mu@@ si@@ c for US $ 0.@@ 9@@ 9 per s@@ ong .
created in 2003 , the i@@ T@@ un@@ es Mu@@ si@@ c st@@ ore recently sur@@ pass@@ ed its 100 milli@@ on@@ th s@@ ale . that is certainly high vol@@ ume .
what i@@ T@@ un@@ es s@@ ells is one form of intellectual con@@ tent .
other forms will follow .
it will be exc@@ iting to see what new forms of intellectual con@@ tent are inv@@ ented in coming years and decades .
the economic revolution - both online and off@@ line - that will be trig@@ ger@@ ed as we learn how to use elec@@ tr@@ oni@@ c money may be as pro@@ found as that w@@ rought by our an@@ ci@@ ent anc@@ est@@ ors &apos; inv@@ en@@ tion of co@@ ins .
the E@@ le@@ ph@@ ant &apos;s C@@ ho@@ ices
new Del@@ hi - A month after they first qu@@ eu@@ ed to vote in India &apos;s m@@ amm@@ ot@@ h general election , the country &apos;s voters will learn the outcome on May 16 .
the election , stag@@ ger@@ ed over five ph@@ ases - invol@@ ving five poll@@ ing days over four weeks , rather than one &quot; election day &quot; - will determine who rules the world &apos;s largest democracy .
only one thing is certain : no single party will win a majority on its own .
India is set for more coalition rule .
that may not be a bad thing .
India &apos;s last two governments each served a full term and pre@@ sid@@ ed over significant economic growth , even though they com@@ pri@@ sed 23 and 20 parties , resp@@ ec@@ tively .
coalition politics gi@@ ves represent@@ ation to the my@@ ri@@ ad interests that make up a di@@ verse and complex society , and en@@ sures that the country as a whole accep@@ ts the policies ultimately adopted .
but coalition rule can also often mean governance of the low@@ est common den@@ omin@@ ator , as resistance by any of the government &apos;s significant members to a policy can del@@ ay or even th@@ war@@ t it .
in India &apos;s parliamentary system , if a coalition los@@ es its majority , the government falls , and keeping allies together can sometimes prove a greater priority than getting things done .
India &apos;s national elections are really an aggregate of thir@@ ty different state elections , each influ@@ enced by its own local consider@@ ations , regional political curr@@ ents , and different pat@@ tern@@ s of political inc@@ um@@ ben@@ cy .
soon after May 16 , the largest single party that emerg@@ es will seek to con@@ struc@@ t a coalition out of a di@@ verse ar@@ ra@@ y of vi@@ c@@ tors from the various states .
several outcomes are possible .
the most likely is that Prime Minister Man@@ mo@@ han Sing@@ h &apos;s Indian National Congress , currently leading the government , emerg@@ es once again as the largest single party and ass@@ em@@ bles a new ruling coalition .
the main alternative would be majority alliance put together by the B@@ har@@ ati@@ ya Jan@@ ata Party ( B@@ J@@ P ) , led by the 8@@ 2 @-@ year @-@ old L@@ al Kri@@ sh@@ n@@ a Ad@@ v@@ ani .
but there is a third possibility : a mot@@ le@@ y collec@@ tion of regional parties , together with the Comm@@ uni@@ sts , gets enough se@@ ats to prevent either of the two big parties from forming a government .
in that case , a &quot; h@@ ung parliament &quot; could see a &quot; third front &quot; coming to power as a minority government , supported tac@@ ti@@ cally by one of the big parties .
this has happened before - and each time , the government that resul@@ ted fell within a year .
each alternative could have serious implications for India .
though the big parties are bro@@ adly committed to continuing an economic policy of liberalization and growth , the B@@ J@@ P is mostly focused on the well @-@ being of India &apos;s mer@@ ch@@ ant class , whereas Congress wi@@ sh@@ es to re@@ distribu@@ te enh@@ anced government revenues to the poor through gener@@ ous social programs .
the left , which would strong@@ ly influence any &quot; third front &quot; government , are staun@@ ch@@ ly op@@ posed to economic liberalization and wish to strengthen , rather than di@@ lu@@ te , India &apos;s large public sector .
in foreign policy , India &apos;s growing clo@@ sen@@ ess with the United States under both the B@@ J@@ P and the Congress has proved contro@@ versi@@ al at home , with le@@ f@@ ti@@ st parties threat@@ ening to s@@ cra@@ p the In@@ do @-@ US nuclear deal and break defense ties with Israel if they come to power .
should the regional parties domin@@ ate the government , domestic politics would strong@@ ly impact India &apos;s foreign policy : the an@@ ger of T@@ ami@@ l voters over events in S@@ ri L@@ ank@@ a , or of Muslims over Gaza , would be reflected in the government and therefore constra@@ in policy options .
the B@@ J@@ P has promised a more ha@@ w@@ k@@ ish security post@@ ure than Congress in the w@@ ake of the M@@ um@@ ba@@ i terrorist attacks , but when it was in power it conduc@@ ted itself remark@@ ably similarly to its ri@@ val , initi@@ ating a peace process with Pakistan .
the biggest differences among the various gro@@ up@@ ings consi@@ st in the t@@ one and ten@@ or of their resp@@ ective vi@@ sions of India .
Congress remains a &quot; big tent &quot; party , committed to pre@@ ser@@ ving India &apos;s plu@@ rali@@ sm and con@@ sci@@ ous of the multi@@ ple identi@@ ties and interests of India &apos;s many pe@@ op@@ les .
the B@@ J@@ P , which acc@@ uses Congress of &quot; appe@@ asing &quot; India &apos;s min@@ orities , he@@ ws to a staun@@ ch@@ ly Hin@@ d@@ u @-@ ch@@ au@@ vin@@ ist line , and has received support from some of the most bi@@ got@@ ed and in@@ toler@@ ant sec@@ tions of Indian society .
the &quot; third front &quot; invol@@ ves ass@@ or@@ ted pet@@ ty particul@@ ar@@ is@@ ms - parties repres@@ enting the sec@@ t@@ arian interests of specific c@@ ast@@ es , su@@ b @-@ regions , or ling@@ ui@@ stic groups .
the danger is that such groups could acc@@ ent@@ u@@ ate the divi@@ sions of a fra@@ cti@@ ous society , rather than pul@@ l everyone together in the collective national interest .
that would be a star@@ t@@ ling change from five years ago .
the 2004 elections were won by the Congress party , led by a wom@@ an political leader of Rom@@ an C@@ atholi@@ c faith and Italian des@@ cent ( S@@ oni@@ a G@@ and@@ hi ) , who made way for a Si@@ k@@ h prime minister ( Man@@ mo@@ han Sing@@ h ) to be s@@ wor@@ n by a Muslim ( President Ab@@ du@@ l K@@ al@@ am ) in a country that is 8@@ 1 % Hin@@ d@@ u .
that single moment cap@@ tured much of what elections have meant for this di@@ verse democracy .
but the ultim@@ ate reality will remain that of a coalition government trying to make progress in a con@@ ten@@ tious poli@@ ty .
in India , policy changes require political consensus within the ruling coalition , labor laws are strong@@ ly defen@@ ded by uni@@ ons and political parties , and contro@@ versi@@ al decisions can be challeng@@ ed on the stre@@ ets , in the cour@@ ts , and ultimately at the poll@@ s .
necessary policy reforms advoc@@ ated by a ruling party are often held ho@@ stage to the pre@@ judi@@ ces of its allies .
so change comes slow@@ ly .
but it does come , and once a policy consensus has been established , it ten@@ ds to be du@@ rable .
Indian democracy has often been lik@@ ened to the stat@@ ely progress of the el@@ ep@@ h@@ ant - pon@@ der@@ ous in its ga@@ it and re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant to change course , but not easily s@@ wa@@ yed from its new path when it does .
the el@@ ep@@ h@@ ant of Indian democracy will acqu@@ ire a new set of ma@@ h@@ outs before the month &apos;s end .
who they are will have a major impact on the fortun@@ es and prospects of one @-@ si@@ x@@ th of human@@ ity .
that alone makes the election results due on May 16 worth the world &apos;s attention .
the eli@@ xi@@ r of E@@ duc@@ ation ?
many people see education as a c@@ ure @-@ all .
they believe that societies can be trans@@ formed by po@@ uring money into raising educ@@ ational standards .
but , while it is right to believe in the power of education - indeed , many sch@@ ol@@ ars are convinc@@ ed that it cre@@ ates he@@ al@@ thi@@ er , more prosp@@ erous citizens - such enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m do@@ es@@ n &apos;t tell us how to get more children to sta@@ y in school longer , or how to ensure that they learn us@@ eful skills while they are there .
today , virtually every Latin American and C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an child en@@ ro@@ ll@@ s in primary school , and most complete several years of sec@@ on@@ dar@@ y education - remark@@ able progress compared to a half @-@ century ago .
yet Latin American and C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an children gain fewer skills in each year of school than students do in high @-@ income countries - and even in some other developing countries .
indi@@ gen@@ ous children have a significantly lower chance of educ@@ ational success .
Gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala , Ha@@ it@@ i , H@@ on@@ dur@@ as , Ni@@ car@@ ag@@ ua , and Par@@ ag@@ u@@ ay lag behind even other Latin American countries .
despite the widespread enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m for li@@ f@@ ting educ@@ ational performance in Latin America and the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an , little effort has been de@@ voted to working out how to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze investments in education .
which policies work best ?
there are my@@ ri@@ ad options .
the World Bank re@@ commen@@ ds de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zing school administration and decision @-@ making so that schools are more respon@@ sive to local needs .
but no reli@@ able studies have established this strategy &apos;s effec@@ tiveness .
bil@@ ing@@ ual education is another sug@@ ges@@ tion that requires further research if we are to establish the benefits .
research in Africa suggests that giving de @-@ wor@@ ming medic@@ ine to primary school pu@@ p@@ ils redu@@ ces the pre@@ val@@ ence of health problems that lower children &apos;s concent@@ ration and atten@@ d@@ ance .
a program to provide te@@ ach@@ ers with monetary incentives and profession@@ al training was recently established in Mexico , but research conduc@@ ted to d@@ ate has found no significant impact on educ@@ ational outcomes .
clearly , there is a deficit of us@@ eful information and serious scientific research in this field .
however , three options should be promot@@ ed .
first , there is credible evidence that children who are better n@@ ou@@ ri@@ shed in their first years of life sta@@ y in school longer and learn more each year that they remain there .
this was first demonstrated in the 19@@ 60 &quot; s , when Gu@@ at@@ em@@ al@@ an rese@@ arch@@ ers gave children in two r@@ and@@ om@@ ly sel@@ ected vil@@ la@@ ges a nut@@ riti@@ ous por@@ ri@@ dge each day , and a much less nut@@ riti@@ ous fru@@ it drin@@ k to children in two other vil@@ la@@ ges .
more recently , B@@ oli@@ via launched the Pro@@ y@@ ec@@ to inte@@ gra@@ l de Des@@ ar@@ ro@@ ll@@ o In@@ f@@ anti@@ l ( P@@ I@@ D@@ I ) , which gave low @-@ income urban children food and ex@@ tra educ@@ ational activities .
this policy can be very af@@ for@@ dable : providing por@@ ri@@ dge in Gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala cost just $ 2@@ 3.@@ 25 per child per year , while the monetary value of the increase in the children &apos;s future wages is between two and four times higher .
a second option is Con@@ di@@ tional C@@ as@@ h Trans@@ fer Progra@@ ms , which provide cash payments to poor households whose children atten@@ d school regul@@ arly .
these programs have been shown to increase en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment and atten@@ d@@ ance .
families in some rural communities of H@@ on@@ dur@@ as , Ni@@ car@@ ag@@ ua , and Mexico get mon@@ th@@ ly cash payments if their children &apos;s school atten@@ d@@ ance rates are 8@@ 5 % or higher .
in Ni@@ car@@ ag@@ ua , these programs have increased school en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment rates by about 13 percentage points .
however , such incentives do not address the problem of low @-@ quality education , and research shows that the benefits do not always out@@ wei@@ gh the costs .
policymakers may choose instead to follow the example of Chile and Col@@ om@@ bia , which give students government money to pay for private education .
in Col@@ om@@ bia , sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ships were provided to 1@@ 2@@ 5@@ ,000 students from poor , urban communities in the early 1990 &quot; s .
where demand exc@@ ee@@ ded supply , private education &quot; v@@ ou@@ cher &quot; re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ents were sel@@ ected by l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y .
each v@@ ou@@ cher cost the Col@@ om@@ bi@@ an government $ 24 a year more than its previous education spending per stu@@ dent , but the v@@ ou@@ ch@@ ers increased atten@@ d@@ ance rates and test sco@@ res .
it is estimated that children in the program increased their future incomes by $ 300 per year .
with the benefits exc@@ ee@@ ding the costs by between 10 and 25 times , this seems to be a sound option .
yet an analysis of Chile &apos;s v@@ ou@@ cher program found no positive effect on students &quot; test sco@@ res or years in school .
instead , the program &apos;s main effect seems to have been to encourage the best students in public schools to s@@ wit@@ ch to private schools .
invest@@ ing in education is vital for Latin America and the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
but much remains un@@ known .
many policy options un@@ ra@@ v@@ el when exam@@ ined clo@@ sely ; others show promise but require more study .
the most expensive programs aren &apos;t necessarily the most successful .
merely wa@@ x@@ ing l@@ y@@ ri@@ cal about the benefits of education will do nothing to help Latin American and C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an countries cat@@ ch up with developed countries .
instead , governments and international organizations should support education policies that have been shown to be effective , encourage research and e@@ val@@ uation of other typ@@ es of education policies and programs , and back non @-@ education policies and programs that improve the quality of life in developing countries .
the el@@ u@@ sive Le@@ g@@ acy of 196@@ 8
&quot; D@@ any , you have been so successful . but don &apos;t let yo@@ ur@@ self be manipul@@ ated by those far @-@ left forces that would lead you to destro@@ y everything that could ari@@ se from what you are creating . &quot;
for@@ ty years later , those words on March 22 , 196@@ 8 , by Jean B@@ au@@ dri@@ l@@ lar@@ d - then an as@@ sist@@ ant prof@@ essor at N@@ an@@ ter@@ re University - still sound right .
I may dis@@ ap@@ point my supporters and those enti@@ ced by &quot; The Revolution , &quot; but I &apos;@@ m not the leader of a revolution that alle@@ ge@@ dly occurred in 196@@ 8 .
for@@ get it : &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; is over - bu@@ ried under co@@ b@@ ble@@ st@@ ones , even if those co@@ b@@ ble@@ st@@ ones made history and trig@@ ger@@ ed radical change in our societies !
at first it seems b@@ af@@ fl@@ ing .
but , as I made clear at the time in my inter@@ view with Jean @-@ Paul S@@ ar@@ tr@@ e in Le N@@ ou@@ v@@ el Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ eu@@ r , I was only the l@@ ou@@ d@@ speak@@ er for a re@@ bel@@ li@@ on .
thus , &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; symboli@@ zed the end of revolution@@ ary my@@ ths - to the benefit of liber@@ ation movements exten@@ ding from the 1970 &quot; s until now .
after all , the world of the 19@@ 60 &quot; s - the first global movement bro@@ ad@@ c@@ ast live on radi@@ o and T@@ V - was defined by a vari@@ ety of in@@ ter @-@ conn@@ ected re@@ vol@@ ts .
the change w@@ rought by &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; affected , above all , traditional culture , hi@@ de@@ bound mor@@ alism , and the principle of hier@@ arch@@ i@@ cal authority .
it al@@ tered social life , ways of being , ways of tal@@ king , ways of lo@@ ving , and so on .
but , despite its sco@@ pe , the movement ste@@ ered clear of violence in order to create a new mo@@ de of re@@ bel@@ li@@ on .
students , workers , and families - all had their legitimate demands , and all nonetheless conver@@ ged on the same desire for em@@ an@@ cip@@ ation .
the re@@ vol@@ t was a form of political ex@@ pression , but its aim was not to sei@@ ze political power as such .
indeed , its exist@@ ential essen@@ ce ren@@ dered it &quot; politically un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able . &quot;
the desire for freedom that car@@ ried the movement forward necessarily el@@ u@@ ded arch@@ ai@@ c mo@@ des of thinking .
as a result , the st@@ eri@@ le c@@ ateg@@ ories of political tradi@@ tion could gain no purch@@ ase on events .
in France , con@@ serv@@ ati@@ sm was so ent@@ ren@@ ched on both the left and the right that both mis@@ sed the movement &apos;s mean@@ ing and could only fall back on ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed revolution@@ ary interpre@@ tations . as for the an@@ arch@@ i@@ sts , their ut@@ op@@ ia of widespread self @-@ management - ti@@ ed to out@@ d@@ ated historical refer@@ ences - appeared entirely un@@ su@@ itable .
starting from an ini@@ tial re@@ jec@@ tion of political institutions and parliament@@ ar@@ ism , we understood only later that the democratic challenge lies in occup@@ ying a politically &quot; nor@@ mali@@ zed &quot; space .
faced with the an@@ arch@@ i@@ sts , with their con@@ fin@@ ing mini@@ ma@@ list political gra@@ mm@@ ar - reflected in the fam@@ ous s@@ lo@@ gan elections , p@@ ie@@ ge à con@@ s ( &quot; elections , a tra@@ p for i@@ di@@ ots &quot; ) - and with the Communist Party , whose revolution@@ ary ide@@ al was eventually linked to tot@@ ali@@ t@@ arian typ@@ es of society , the future of May 196@@ 8 could only shift to the right with the election victory of General de G@@ au@@ lle .
it was , un@@ deni@@ ably , a political failure .
but just as un@@ deni@@ able was the huge tre@@ m@@ or that sho@@ ok our ante@@ di@@ lu@@ vi@@ an conc@@ ep@@ tions of society , mor@@ als , and the state .
challeng@@ ing authorit@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , the re@@ vol@@ t trig@@ ger@@ ed an explo@@ sion at the heart of the typically French two @-@ head@@ ed power structure , which combined a domin@@ ant G@@ au@@ lli@@ sm and a Communist Party man@@ aging the working class .
thus , the ra@@ dic@@ alism of the up@@ heav@@ al eventually liber@@ ated the ple@@ as@@ ure to live .
with a new generation emerg@@ es a new political ima@@ gin@@ ation and po@@ e@@ tic mot@@ to@@ s w@@ ritten on w@@ all@@ s .
the sur@@ reali@@ st essen@@ ce of the re@@ bel@@ li@@ on was som@@ eh@@ ow symboli@@ zed by G@@ il@@ les Car@@ on &apos;s fam@@ ous ph@@ ot@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ h , in which an in@@ sol@@ ent s@@ mi@@ le at a ri@@ ot poli@@ c@@ em@@ an sub@@ ver@@ ts the f@@ ro@@ zen , established order to the point of making it ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
of course , some people have never overcome the end of the ec@@ st@@ as@@ y of those five weeks of cra@@ z@@ iness and jo@@ y , while others still wait for &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; to cul@@ min@@ ate in G@@ od only knows what kind of &quot; D @-@ D@@ ay . &quot;
for my part , I accepted the &quot; principle of reality &quot; long ago , without no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a - and without mini@@ mi@@ zing the importance of what happened .
for &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; was , indeed , a re@@ bel@@ li@@ on jo@@ ining two er@@ as .
it cra@@ ck@@ ed the yo@@ ke of con@@ serv@@ ati@@ sm and tot@@ ali@@ t@@ arian thought , enab@@ ling the desire for personal and collective autonom@@ y and freedom to ex@@ press itself .
from the cultural point of view , we won .
so , revi@@ si@@ t &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; ?
yes , but only in order to understand it , gra@@ s@@ p its sco@@ pe , and re@@ tain what still makes sense today .
kno@@ wing , for example , that 23 years after World War II , a multi@@ c@@ olo@@ red France demonstrated against my de@@ port@@ ation by claim@@ ing &quot; W@@ e are all German Je@@ ws &quot; provides food for thought .
but this does not justi@@ fy the ha@@ st@@ y compar@@ is@@ on - and even less the identi@@ fication - of every prot@@ est today with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 . &quot;
after 40 years , the context has changed radi@@ cally .
the world of the Cold War is gone , as are schools and fac@@ t@@ ories organi@@ zed like bar@@ ra@@ cks , authoritarian trade uni@@ ons , ga@@ y bas@@ h@@ ing , and women &apos;s oblig@@ ation to receive per@@ mission from their h@@ us@@ b@@ ands before being able to work or open a bank account .
that world has been re@@ placed by a multilateral world , which includes AIDS , unemployment , energy and climate crises , and so on .
so let &apos;s per@@ mit new gener@@ ations to defin@@ e their own batt@@ les and desi@@ res .
Dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fying &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 &quot; also ex@@ poses the pre@@ ten@@ se of those who would blame it for all the wr@@ on@@ gs of today &apos;s world .
because the &quot; &quot; 6@@ 8 generation &quot; w@@ ro@@ te on the w@@ all@@ s &quot; I@@ t is for@@ bi@@ d@@ den to for@@ bi@@ d , &quot; some hold it responsible for urban violence , extreme individu@@ alism , the crisis in education , exec@@ uti@@ ves &quot; &quot; g@@ ol@@ den par@@ ach@@ utes , &quot; the decline of authority , and - why not ? - climate change .
in this way , such people hope that they can ev@@ ade their du@@ ty to explain today &apos;s problems .
but how can one not interpre@@ t this as a political tri@@ ck aimed at s@@ ab@@ ot@@ aging the moderni@@ zation of ex@@ pression , thereby clos@@ ing off any space for rational debate ?
the el@@ u@@ sive Se@@ arch for Global Financial R@@ ul@@ es
Brussels - I@@ f the financial crisis is global , it is said , then the solution must be global : an international financial system that works better . and , because the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods institutions ( B@@ W@@ I@@ s ) - the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - form the center of the international financial system , they must be inclu@@ ded in the solution .
an enh@@ anced international financial system must pursue two main lines of action .
the first is to bro@@ aden the sco@@ pe of international cooperation .
at the moment , the Financial St@@ ability Bo@@ ard , whose members include the G @-@ 20 countries , mainly pursu@@ es initiatives in this field .
a second line of action is to strengthen the international institutions &quot; soft powers to aim for more consist@@ ent economic policies , especially by systemi@@ cally important economies .
this would directly invol@@ ve the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods institutions , not@@ ably the IMF .
a strengthening of the IMF was agreed after the Asian crisis in the 1990 &quot; s , and the G @-@ 7 summit in C@@ olo@@ g@@ ne in 1999 mand@@ ated the Fund to play a strong surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance role to ensure greater transparency and encourage early adjustment by countries with un@@ sustainable balance @-@ of @-@ payments positions .
but , over the last decade , the expectations raised by this mandate have not been met .
some emerging economies did not let their currencies flo@@ at but , instead , continued to pe@@ g them at under@@ valu@@ ed exchange rates in order to promote their exports and build up reserves as a form of insurance in case of crisis .
moreover , the IMF has not succ@@ ee@@ ded in convinc@@ ing countries to pursue macroeconomic policies consist@@ ent with sustainable current @-@ account positions .
nor have advanced economies , particularly the United States , taken IMF ad@@ vice fully into consider@@ ation .
the accumul@@ ation of large sur@@ pl@@ uses , especially in emerging Asian economies and oil @-@ expor@@ ting countries , enab@@ led the US to finance its current @-@ account deficit . it also lo@@ wer@@ ed long @-@ term interest rates in the US and made monetary conditions there more expan@@ sion@@ ary .
emerging economies , following the advanced countries , also att@@ ach@@ ed less importance to Fund surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance , especially as their accumul@@ ation of external assets made them less dependent on IMF financing and ad@@ vice .
for example , the Fund has been unable to complete a surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance program with China for three years .
all this occurred against the back@@ ground of emerging @-@ market economies &quot; claims that their relatively low represent@@ ation in the B@@ W@@ I@@ s deni@@ ed the IMF legitimacy .
in recent months , the Fund played an important role in resol@@ ving the crisis , in particular by assess@@ ing the gra@@ v@@ ity of the situation and providing countries with external finance .
but , if we are to create an international monetary system in which crises are the exc@@ eption , the Fund must play a greater pre@@ ven@@ tive role .
there seems to be a sense of deni@@ al in several countries that large external imbalances were a cause of the crisis .
these imbalances ultimately reflected the accumul@@ ation of excessive international liquidity by countries like the US , st@@ em@@ ming from excessive savings by countries like China .
this sp@@ ur@@ red an un@@ sustainable consumption boom , as well as un@@ war@@ ran@@ ted risk @-@ taking by consumers and financial institutions , which contribu@@ ted to the large dist@@ or@@ tions and bub@@ bles in global financial markets that were the pre@@ conditions for the current crisis .
the risk now is that the forces favor@@ ing earlier and effective adjustment of imbalances have been weak@@ ened .
indeed , few today are call@@ ing for the IMF to play a stronger role in prev@@ enting the accumul@@ ation of excessive external imbalances and in fo@@ ster@@ ing more discipl@@ ined domestic policies .
an example of this is the way the IMF &apos;s D@@ eci@@ sion on bilateral S@@ ur@@ v@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance over M@@ em@@ bers &quot; Poli@@ cies , aimed at identi@@ fying fundamental exchange @-@ rate mis@@ ali@@ gn@@ ments , was modi@@ fied to allow greater dis@@ cre@@ tion in surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance , especially over exchange rates .
this might look like a tac@@ ti@@ cal choice , but I doubt that it will result in a stronger hand for the IMF .
emerging and developing countries are dem@@ anding a stronger vo@@ ice in the IMF , but they also seem to be suggest@@ ing that they would like it to be less in@@ tru@@ sive and less able to impose condi@@ tion@@ ality - while si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously providing more and che@@ ap@@ er financing .
this might be appropriate in times of systemi@@ c crisis , but it is not sustainable in normal times .
indeed , some thought should be given to an exit strategy from che@@ ap and un@@ condi@@ tional IMF financing .
instead , most IMF share@@ holders seem to favor making the organization &apos;s financing easier .
enh@@ ancing the role of its Sp@@ eci@@ al Dra@@ wing Ri@@ ghts ( SD@@ R@@ s ) , or sup@@ ple@@ ment@@ ing the dollar with another world reser@@ ve currency , would help facilit@@ ate the financing needs of both deficit and surplus countries .
for deficit countries , borrowing from international institutions outside the markets would be easier , giving the issu@@ er of such currency some form of international len@@ der @-@ of @-@ last @-@ res@@ ort func@@ tion .
for surplus countries that want to accumul@@ ate reserves , it would reduce exchange @-@ rate risk .
but , if financing were to become easier , it would be un@@ clear how both creditors and deb@@ tors would percei@@ ve the risk of excessive imbalances .
the real danger is that adjustment would take place even later , with imbalances left to accumul@@ ate for a longer period of time .
under these circumstances , crises could be even greater , and the adjust@@ ments har@@ sh@@ er - as occurred under the last world currency , the gold standard .
a vi@@ able international financial system requires a mechanism to keep imbalances in ch@@ eck .
an essential el@@ ement of such a mechanism is to give the IMF a promin@@ ent role in two areas : strong and effective surv@@ ei@@ ll@@ ance in order to prevent crises , and responsible lending to countries in need , but with appropriate limits and condi@@ tion@@ ality .
we don &apos;t need to re@@ inv@@ ent the whe@@ el ; we just need to follow up on the commitments made ten years ago .
de@@ aling with the short @-@ run challenges of the current crisis should not di@@ stra@@ c@@ t us from the objective of prev@@ enting future m@@ elt@@ dow@@ ns .
emerging World R@@ is@@ ing
London - No@@ w that the leadership issues in the United States and China have been sett@@ led , we can finally fra@@ me the economic out@@ look for 2013 with the knowledge of who will be pul@@ ling the policy le@@ vers in the world &apos;s two biggest economies .
so , what will they do - and , perhaps more important , what will economic forces do to them ?
for star@@ ters , the US will face rec@@ ur@@ ring challenges with the &quot; fiscal cli@@ ff &quot; until financial markets pressure policymakers into more radical deficit reduction .
but , despite this and associated growth dis@@ appoin@@ t@@ ments , 2013 will be a stronger year for the global economy than many people expect .
in 2011 , China contribu@@ ted $ 1.@@ 3 trillion in additional GDP to the world , the equivalent of creating another Greece every 1@@ 2.@@ 5 weeks , or close to another Spain every year .
together , the four BR@@ I@@ C countries ( Brazil , Russia , India , and China ) contribu@@ ted around $ 2.@@ 2 trillion in 2012 , equivalent to another Italy every year .
( despite its problems , Italy is still the world &apos;s ei@@ gh@@ th @-@ largest economy , and will be for at least the next cou@@ ple of years , until Russia and India possibly over@@ take it ) .
the eight growth market economies - the BR@@ IC@@ s plus South Korea , Indonesia , Mexico , and Turkey - created close to $ 3 trillion in 2011 , more than the United Kingdom in one year .
these economies &quot; combined size is now appro@@ xim@@ ately that of the US economy , with total annual output reaching $ 15 @-@ 16 trillion , or roughly 25 % of global GDP .
unless their growth rates slow sharply , their contribu@@ tion to world output will rise dramatically , and global growth will be stronger than wor@@ ried Western analy@@ sts might appreci@@ ate .
if the &quot; Gro@@ w@@ th Ei@@ ght &quot; economies exp@@ anded by 10 % on average in US dollar terms , they would add $ 1.@@ 5 trillion to global GDP next year .
for the decade that began in 2011 , we at Gold@@ man Sach@@ s As@@ set Man@@ agement have assum@@ ed that China , which accounts for about half of total Gro@@ w@@ th Ei@@ ght output ( probably $ 8@@ .@@ 3 trillion by the end of 2012 ) , will grow at a 7 @-@ 8 % annual rate in real terms , with inflation around 3 % .
unless the renminbi falls in value , this trans@@ l@@ ates into an average nomin@@ al increase of at least 10 @-@ 11 % in dollar terms .
China will grow by 7 @-@ 8 % partly because that is what policymakers have decided they want .
in late 2009 , within a year of their massive policy stimulus in response to the global credit crisis , the Chinese leadership , I believe , decided that 10 % annual real growth had out@@ li@@ ved its us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
income inequality was rising dramatically , environmental damage was wor@@ sen@@ ing rapidly , and inflation was leading to weak real @-@ income growth for poor households .
indeed , a key reason for China &apos;s slowdown in 2011 @-@ 2012 is that officials wanted it .
while the real GDP growth rate st@@ ated in the 1@@ 2@@ th Fi@@ ve @-@ Y@@ e@@ ar Plan should not be viewed as a fa@@ it ac@@ com@@ pl@@ i , the fact that the Plan &apos;s growth rate was lo@@ wer@@ ed to 7 % is a powerful sign@@ al of official in@@ tent .
looking ahead , while China &apos;s leadership change is important , the country &apos;s leaders cannot decide things with the freedom that one might think .
they become leaders partly through commitment to the agreed plan .
a potential leader who devi@@ ates too much does not sta@@ y in the leadership , as we saw in 2012 with the pur@@ ge of B@@ o X@@ il@@ ai .
China &apos;s 7 % growth target , while subject to a number of challenges , is based on maintaining private consumption growth of around 8 % ( while recogni@@ zing that exports and investment will not grow as strong@@ ly as before ) , thereby allowing the consumption share of GDP to rise .
more focus on innovation and cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity will be ac@@ compani@@ ed by strong real wage growth , provi@@ sion of greater rights for urban migrants , and expansion of health care and pen@@ sions .
if China grow@@ s by 7 @-@ 8 % again in 2013 , it will be more balanced growth than in 2012 .
beyond China , the other BR@@ IC@@ s - Brazil , Russia , and India - all face challenges that their policymakers need to meet to sp@@ ur stronger growth .
but there are pl@@ enty of exc@@ iting developments elsewhere , including Indonesia , the Philipp@@ ines , Banglades@@ h , Nigeria , and Mexico - all part of what I call the &quot; N@@ ex@@ t 11 . &quot;
South Korea and Turkey , which continue to grow reason@@ ably well , al@@ beit not with the others &quot; moment@@ um , are two of this group &apos;s other big members .
the 15 countries that com@@ pri@@ se the BR@@ IC@@ s and the N@@ ex@@ t 11 con@@ tain more than four billion people , close to two @-@ thir@@ ds of the world &apos;s population .
as they continue to grow , their share of the world economy will continue to rise , boo@@ sting global growth beyond what it otherwise would be .
but the global economy could be weak@@ er in 2013 than it was in 2012 if the worst continues to prev@@ ail in Europe and the US , particularly if the new US Congress cannot work with a re @-@ elected President Barack Obama to find a budget deal that impro@@ ves the medium @-@ term credibility of the US fiscal position while avoi@@ ding excessive deficit cutting .
this is a difficult balance to achieve , and , without pressure from the markets , I am uns@@ ure how it will play out .
I should add , however , that if the US government does not cause problems , two private @-@ sector developments seem likely to be help@@ ful .
one is growing evidence of a housing recovery ; the other is the prospect of ste@@ adi@@ ly declining energy @-@ im@@ port costs as domestic production , particularly of natural gas , continues to rise .
as for Europe , many investors still assu@@ me that a moment will arri@@ ve when we can defini@@ tively conclu@@ de that European Monetary Union is fini@@ shed or sa@@ ved .
unfortunately , it is much more likely that , at least ahead of Germany &apos;s au@@ tum@@ n 2013 elections , key decisions will be post@@ pon@@ ed or avoi@@ ded .
this means that Europe probably faces another challeng@@ ing year .
but , again , the BR@@ IC@@ s &quot; output growth amounts to creating the equivalent of another Italy every 12 months .
unless the European environment de@@ teri@@ or@@ ates sharply , Europe &apos;s tra@@ v@@ ails will not be the main story for the global economy in 2013 .
the E@@ m@@ erg@@ ing @-@ Mark@@ et Gro@@ w@@ th Eng@@ ine
new D@@ E@@ L@@ H@@ I - The key role of emerging and developing countries - including India , China , and Brazil - in susta@@ ining world economic growth was brought into sharp focus during the recent global crisis , and has been well do@@ cum@@ ented .
this trend is likely to continue in 2011 and beyond .
indeed , the IMF expec@@ ts that emerging and developing economies will grow by 6 % in 2010 and 6@@ .@@ 3 % in 2011 .
emerging @-@ market economies have not only c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned the global impact of the recent crisis , but have also helped industri@@ alized countries re@@ verse the rec@@ ession@@ ary trend of 2008 @-@ 2009 .
but recovery remains fragi@@ le in the developed world , with unemployment rema@@ ining at crisis levels .
but , while emerging economies are pro@@ ving to be dri@@ vers of global demand , the right mi@@ x of government initiatives and policies is still required to ensure that they continue to provide the imp@@ et@@ us for faster world economic recovery in the short term and be the eng@@ ines of sustainable growth in the medium and long term .
there is also a strong need for supporting long @-@ term capital flows to emerging economies to stimul@@ ate investment further , particularly in their infrastructure sectors , thereby in@@ jec@@ ting much @-@ needed additional demand into the global economy .
in this regard , another important development is the increasing number of emerging @-@ market middle @-@ class consumers , their growing purch@@ asing power , and thus their potential impact on global demand .
according to one estim@@ ate , middle @-@ class consumers in a do@@ zen emerging economies today wi@@ eld annual purch@@ asing power tot@@ aling appro@@ xim@@ ately $ 6@@ .@@ 9 trillion .
indeed , pro@@ jec@@ tions from Mc@@ Kin@@ se@@ y &amp; amp ; Com@@ p@@ any suggest that the purch@@ asing power of this rising middle class in emerging markets may rise to $ 20 trillion over the next decade - twi@@ ce the current level of consumption in the United States .
the four biggest emerging economies - Brazil , Russia , India , and China ( the BR@@ IC@@ s ) - are large produc@@ ers and consumers of goods and services , and will also be important in shap@@ ing the pace , direction , and sustain@@ ability of global economic growth .
let me turn to India speci@@ fic@@ ally .
in the five years prec@@ e@@ ding the 2008 @-@ 2009 crisis , the Indian economy gre@@ w at an average rate of nearly 9 % annually .
during the crisis , annual growth slow@@ ed , but only to 6@@ .@@ 7 % , reflec@@ ting the economy &apos;s inher@@ ent re@@ sili@@ ence .
the growth rate sub@@ sequ@@ ently reco@@ vered to 7@@ .@@ 4 % in 2009 @-@ 2010 , and we expect 9 % growth by 2011 @-@ 12 .
the strength of the Indian economy is under@@ p@@ inn@@ ed by a high saving rate and robu@@ st investment .
the government &apos;s pro@@ mp@@ t action to counter the crisis - fiscal stimulus , growth pack@@ ages , and monetary easing - proved effective .
a sound financial and banking system with limited ex@@ pos@@ ure to global markets , together with the importance of domestic consumption in susta@@ ining demand , has also helped .
but what dist@@ ing@@ ui@@ sh@@ es India from other emerging economies , in particular China and the Sou@@ the@@ ast Asian countries , is that domestic demand , rather than exports , is the primary dri@@ ver of growth .
a return to high growth rates glob@@ ally will require a broader revi@@ val of demand .
ne@@ ed@@ less to say , this will occur only gradu@@ ally , particularly in the developed countries .
thus , India &apos;s high growth rates will have to remain dependent on strong domestic demand .
in order to meet this challenge , we are foc@@ using on investments in infrastructure sectors such as power , tel@@ ec@@ om@@ m@@ unic@@ ations , ro@@ ads , ports , and air@@ ports .
while the public sector will continue to play an important role , given the massive investment required , substantial private investment - including foreign investment - would be needed to address India &apos;s huge &quot; infrastructure deficit &quot; and the financing gap that ac@@ companies it .
a strategy of private @-@ public partner@@ ship has been adopted to address the infrastructure challenge .
at the same time , we need to invest in our human capital , supporting the development and up@@ gra@@ ding of the work@@ force &apos;s skills and capacity for innovation .
at its summit in Se@@ ou@@ l in November , the G @-@ 20 fir@@ m@@ ly placed development at the core of its agenda .
Indian Prime Minister Man@@ mo@@ han Sing@@ h , under@@ lin@@ ing the importance of infrastructure investment , made the following proposal , which several leaders end@@ or@@ sed : &quot; rec@@ y@@ c@@ ling surplus savings into investment in developing countries will not only address the immediate demand im@@ balance , it will also help to address develop@@ mental imbalances .
in other words , we should leverage imbalances of one kind to re@@ d@@ ress imbalances of the other kind . &quot;
as we head into the second decade of the century , innovative ideas like using global savings or sur@@ pl@@ uses to finance infrastructure in emerging and developing countries should be pursu@@ ed seriously .
doing so would not only sustain the growth moment@@ um of these economies , but would contribute to global recovery by gener@@ ating much @-@ needed additional demand in the developed countries .
while the emerging economies &quot; global role will inevit@@ ably grow in the coming years , this shift will need to be an@@ cho@@ red in a co@@ oper@@ ative partner@@ ship with the developed world .
as for India , our re@@ sili@@ ent democratic values , ability to manage diversi@@ ty , and strong economic fundament@@ als under@@ p@@ in our country &apos;s current global post@@ ure .
the emo@@ tional C@@ las@@ h of C@@ i@@ vili@@ zations
throughout the so @-@ called &quot; war on terror , &quot; the no@@ tion of a &quot; clas@@ h of civili@@ zation &quot; between Islam and the West has usually been dis@@ mis@@ sed as politically inc@@ or@@ rec@@ t and intellec@@ tually wr@@ on@@ gh@@ e@@ ad@@ ed .
instead , the most common interpre@@ tation has been that the world has enter@@ ed a new era characteri@@ zed by conflict &quot; within &quot; a particular civili@@ zation , nam@@ ely Islam , with fundament@@ alist Muslims as much at war against moder@@ ates as against the West .
the strategic conclu@@ sion deri@@ ved from such an analysis was clear , ambi@@ tious , and easily su@@ mm@@ ari@@ zed : democra@@ ti@@ zation .
if the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem , bringing democracy to the &quot; Gre@@ ater Middle @-@ East would be the solution , and it was the historical du@@ ty of the United States , as the most powerful and moral nation , to bring about that necessary change .
the status quo was un@@ ten@@ able .
implement@@ ing democracy , with or without regime change , was the only alternative to cha@@ os and the rise of fundament@@ alism .
today , Iraq may be on the ver@@ ge of civil war between Shi@@ it@@ es and Sun@@ nis .
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving ir@@ re@@ si@@ sti@@ bly towards pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ing a nuclear capacity .
a free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine , and the un@@ fortun@@ ate ep@@ i@@ so@@ de of the D@@ anish newspap@@ er car@@ to@@ ons illu@@ str@@ ated the almost com@@ bus@@ ti@@ ble nature of relations between Islam and the West .
all of these developments are pa@@ ving the way to new interpre@@ tations .
rather than a &quot; clas@@ h of civili@@ zations , &quot; we might instead be faced by multi@@ ple la@@ yers of conflict , which inter@@ act with each other in ways that increase global instability .
indeed , it appears that the world is wi@@ tn@@ ess@@ ing a tri@@ ple conflict .
there is a clas@@ h within Islam , which , if the violence in Iraq sp@@ read@@ s to neighbor@@ ing countries , risks causing regional destabili@@ zation .
there is also a clas@@ h that is best descri@@ bed not as being between Islam and the West , but between the sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed world and a growing religious one .
at an even deeper and at@@ avi@@ stic level , there is an emo@@ tional clas@@ h between a culture of fear and a culture of hu@@ mili@@ ation .
it would be a gro@@ ss over@@ simp@@ li@@ fication to spe@@ ak , as some are doing , of a clas@@ h between civili@@ zation and bar@@ bar@@ ism .
in reality , we are confron@@ ted with a wi@@ den@@ ing divi@@ de over the role of religion , which r@@ uns between the West ( with the US being a complic@@ ated exc@@ eption ) and much of the rest of the world ( the most not@@ able exc@@ eption being China ) , but particularly the Islamic world .
the divi@@ de reflects how religion defin@@ es an individual &apos;s identity within a society .
at a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere , we Europeans have largely for@@ got@@ ten our ( violent and in@@ toler@@ ant ) religious past , and we have difficul@@ ty understanding the role that religion can play in other pe@@ op@@ les &quot; da@@ i@@ ly lives .
in some ways , &quot; they &quot; are our own bu@@ ried past and , with a combination of ignor@@ ance , pre@@ judi@@ ce , and , above all , fear , &quot; we &quot; are af@@ ra@@ id that &quot; they &quot; could defin@@ e our future .
we live in a secular world , where free speech can easily turn into in@@ sensi@@ tive and ir@@ responsible mo@@ ck@@ er@@ y , while others see religion as their su@@ pre@@ me goal , if not their last hope .
they have tried everything , from nationalism to region@@ alism , from commun@@ ism to capitalism .
since everything has failed , why not give G@@ od a chance ?
globalization may not have created these la@@ yers of conflicts , but it has acceler@@ ated them by making the differences more vi@@ sible and pal@@ p@@ able .
in our glob@@ alized age , we have lost the pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ge - and , parado@@ xi@@ cally , the vir@@ tu@@ e - of ignor@@ ance .
we all see how others feel and re@@ act , but without the minim@@ al historical and cultural tools necessary to deci@@ ph@@ er those re@@ actions .
globalization has pa@@ ved the way to a world domin@@ ated by the dictator@@ ship of emo@@ tions - and of ignor@@ ance .
this clas@@ h of emo@@ tions is exac@@ erb@@ ated in the case of Islam .
in the Arab world , in particular , Islam is domin@@ ated by a culture of hu@@ mili@@ ation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main los@@ ers , the worst victims , of a new and un@@ just international system .
from that stand@@ point , the Israel @-@ Palestine conflict is ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
it has become an ob@@ s@@ ession .
it is not so much that Ara@@ bs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians .
on the contrary , the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades .
in reality , for them the conflict has come to symboli@@ ze the an@@ ach@@ roni@@ stic per@@ pet@@ uation of an un@@ fair coloni@@ al order , to represent their political mal@@ ai@@ se , and to em@@ body the perceived im@@ possibility of their being ma@@ sters of their de@@ stin@@ y .
in the e@@ yes of the Ara@@ bs ( and some other Muslims ) , Israel &apos;s strength and re@@ sili@@ ence is a direct consequ@@ ence of their own weak@@ ness , divi@@ sions , and corruption .
the majority of Ara@@ bs may not support al @-@ Qaeda , but they do not op@@ pose it with all their heart .
instead , there is the temp@@ tation to regard O@@ sama bin L@@ aden as a type of violent R@@ ob@@ in Ho@@ od , whose actions , while impossible to con@@ done offici@@ ally , have helped them to reco@@ ver a sense of Arab pri@@ de and dig@@ n@@ ity .
here , perhaps , is the real clas@@ h of civili@@ zations : the emo@@ tional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim , particularly Arab , culture of hu@@ mili@@ ation .
it would be dangerous to under@@ estim@@ ate the dep@@ th of so wide an emo@@ tional divi@@ de , and to recognize its exist@@ ence is the first step to over@@ coming it .
but that will be difficult , for trans@@ c@@ ending the emo@@ tional clas@@ h of civili@@ zations pre@@ sup@@ poses an opening to the &quot; other &quot; that neither side may yet be ready to under@@ take .
the Emp@@ ire of Hum@@ an Ri@@ ghts
new YORK - W@@ h@@ y are French , British , and American war@@ ships , but not Chinese or Malay@@ sian war@@ ships , si@@ t@@ ting near the Bur@@ m@@ ese co@@ ast lo@@ ad@@ ed with food and other nec@@ essi@@ ties for the victims of Cy@@ cl@@ one N@@ ar@@ g@@ is ?
why has the As@@ soci@@ ation of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) been so slow and weak in its response to a natural cal@@ ami@@ ty that ra@@ v@@ aged one of its own members ?
the French j@@ uni@@ or Hum@@ an Ri@@ ghts Minister , R@@ ama Y@@ ade , declared that the United Nations &quot; principle of the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; should be app@@ lied to Burma , for@@ ci@@ bly if necessary .
and the Malay@@ sian opposition leader L@@ im K@@ it si@@ ang has said that Asian countries &quot; in@@ action &quot; reflects dis@@ m@@ ally on all ASEAN leaders and governments .
they can defin@@ it@@ ely do more . &quot;
so , are Europeans and Americans simply more comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate than Asi@@ ans ?
given the West &apos;s record of hor@@ ren@@ d@@ ous war@@ fare and often bru@@ tal imperi@@ alism , this seems unlikely .
moreover , the way ordinary Chinese r@@ al@@ lied to help victims of the ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Sich@@ uan has been quite remark@@ able , as have been the sp@@ on@@ tan@@ e@@ ous efforts of people in Burma to as@@ sist their fel@@ low citizens , even as the military did very little .
Bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sm st@@ res@@ ses comp@@ as@@ sion and mer@@ cy as much as Christi@@ an@@ ity does .
indi@@ ffer@@ ence to suffering is not inher@@ ent to any Asian culture .
indeed , none of the Asian members dis@@ agreed when the UN General As@@ sem@@ bly adopted the Uni@@ vers@@ al Dec@@ lar@@ ation of Hum@@ an Ri@@ ghts in 194@@ 8 .
the dec@@ lar@@ ation held that &quot; recognition of the inher@@ ent dig@@ n@@ ity and of the equal and in@@ alien@@ able rights of all members of the human family is the found@@ ation of freedom , justice , and peace in the world . &quot;
nevertheless , there may be cultural differences in understanding how comp@@ as@@ sion should be app@@ lied .
the ide@@ al of universal equ@@ ality and rights does o@@ we something to the history of Western civili@@ zation , from So@@ c@@ rates &quot; &quot; natural justice &quot; to Christi@@ an@@ ity and France &apos;s Dec@@ lar@@ ation of the Ri@@ ghts of M@@ an .
Western pe@@ op@@ les have not always li@@ ved up to their univers@@ alist ide@@ als , but they have in modern times built institutions designed to implement them , in Europe and beyond .
there is , so far , no Asia @-@ wide institution to protect the human rights of Asi@@ ans , let alone m@@ ank@@ in@@ d .
in fact , Chinese and other Asi@@ ans frequ@@ ently criti@@ ci@@ ze the West for using human rights as an exc@@ use to impose &quot; Western values &quot; on former coloni@@ al sub@@ jects .
to be sure , such acc@@ us@@ ations are especially common in auto@@ cra@@ cies whose ru@@ lers , and their a@@ po@@ logi@@ sts , view the idea of universal human rights as a threat to their mon@@ opo@@ ly on power .
but di@@ stru@@ st of univers@@ alism in Asia is not con@@ fin@@ ed to auto@@ crats .
in many Asian countries , favor@@ s inv@@ ari@@ ably create oblig@@ ations , which is perhaps why people are sometimes disin@@ c@@ lin@@ ed to inter@@ f@@ ere in the problems of others .
you are ob@@ li@@ ged to take care of your family , your fri@@ ends , or even your fel@@ low coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men . but the idea of universal char@@ ity is too ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t , and sm@@ acks of the kind of un@@ wel@@ come inter@@ ference that Western imperi@@ alists - and the Christi@@ an mis@@ sion@@ aries who followed them - practi@@ ced in the East for too long .
the no@@ tion of &quot; Asian values , &quot; promot@@ ed mostly by Sing@@ a@@ po@@ re@@ an official s@@ cri@@ bes , was partly a criti@@ que of univers@@ alist Western claims .
Asi@@ ans , according to this theory , have their own values , which include th@@ ri@@ ft , de@@ ference to authority , the s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of individual to collective interests , and the belief that countries should not sti@@ ck their no@@ ses into others &quot; affairs .
h@@ ence , the he@@ si@@ t@@ ant response of Sou@@ the@@ ast Asian governments - and public opinion - to the Bur@@ m@@ ese disaster .
one possible line of criticism of this kind of thinking is simply to claim the sup@@ eri@@ ority of Western values .
but another , more sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic response would be to show that individual rights and no@@ tions of freedom are by no means ali@@ en to non @-@ Western civili@@ zations .
Am@@ ar@@ t@@ ya S@@ en , the Nobel Pri@@ ze @-@ winn@@ ing economist , has poin@@ ted out that great Indian ru@@ lers , such as A@@ sho@@ ka ( third century B@@ C ) and Ak@@ bar ( si@@ x@@ te@@ enth century ) , advoc@@ ated plu@@ rali@@ sm , toler@@ ance , and reason long before the European En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
he has also obser@@ ved that fam@@ ines don &apos;t occur in democracies , because freedom of information help@@ s to prevent them .
S@@ en , not surpri@@ sing@@ ly , is a tren@@ ch@@ ant cri@@ tic of the &quot; Asian values &quot; school .
it has , nonetheless , become a com@@ mon@@ ly held opinion that democracy , like universal human rights , is a typically Western idea , and that Asian auto@@ cracy , as practi@@ ced in China , for example , is not only more su@@ ited to Asi@@ ans , but also more efficient .
democratic governments are ham@@ per@@ ed by lob@@ by groups , special interests , public opinion , party politics , and so for@@ th , while Asian auto@@ crats can make un@@ popular but necessary decisions .
the two recent natural disa@@ sters in Burma and China have put this idea to a severe test .
China has not fa@@ red too b@@ adly , largely because its government was forced by the Bur@@ m@@ ese example , bad publi@@ city sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing the Ti@@ bet@@ an demon@@ stra@@ tions , and the im@@ pen@@ ding Olympi@@ c G@@ ames to allow far more freedom of information than it norm@@ ally does .
one can only hope that this cra@@ ck of freedom will wi@@ den in time .
Burma failed mis@@ er@@ ably , and , despite bel@@ ated efforts to make the best of ter@@ ri@@ ble circumstances , so has ASEAN .
in the end , of course , it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t matter much whether or not we as@@ cri@@ be the fail@@ ures of auto@@ cracy and non @-@ intervention to anything speci@@ fic@@ ally &quot; Asian . &quot;
whatever the cause , the consequences remain de@@ pl@@ or@@ able .
global Institu@@ tions after the Cri@@ sis
O@@ x@@ ford - W@@ hen L@@ eh@@ man Bro@@ thers collap@@ sed and the global financial crisis er@@ up@@ ted five years ago , many g@@ li@@ mp@@ sed a sil@@ ver lin@@ ing : the promise of more effective global economic governance .
but , despite a fl@@ ur@@ ry of early initiatives , the world remains as far from that goal as ever .
the Financial St@@ ability Bo@@ ard ( FS@@ B ) , established after the G @-@ 20 summit in London in April 2009 , has no legal mandate or en@@ for@@ cement powers , nor formal proc@@ esses for including all countries .
the International Monetary Fund still a@@ wa@@ its the doub@@ ling of its capital ( another early vo@@ w ) , while its existing resources are heavily ti@@ ed up in Europe and its governance reforms are st@@ all@@ ed .
the World Bank has received a modest increase in resources , but it has yet to build capacity to l@@ end rapidly and glob@@ ally beyond existing borro@@ wers and lo@@ an arrangements , and its income tra@@ jec@@ tory is di@@ mini@@ shing .
yet the need for effective global economic governance remains more urg@@ ent than ever .
banks and other financial firms ro@@ am internation@@ ally , great@@ ly as@@ sist@@ ed by market @-@ opening rules em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in trade and investment tre@@ ati@@ es , but with no leg@@ ally en@@ for@@ ce@@ able responsibility to provi@@ sion adequ@@ ately for their own losses when things go wrong .
instead , massive risks have sup@@ pos@@ edly been held at ba@@ y by vol@@ unt@@ ary standards pro@@ mul@@ g@@ ated by a pat@@ ch@@ work of public and private &quot; standard @-@ setting &quot; organizations .
the crisis proved that this was in@@ adequate .
the ti@@ t@@ ans of Wall Street and the City of London were ex@@ posed as hu@@ g@@ ely over @-@ le@@ ver@@ aged .
extra@@ ordinary profits when their be@@ ts paid off increased their financial and political power - which they still enjo@@ y - with taxpay@@ ers left to ba@@ il them out when their be@@ ts turned bad .
the G @-@ 20 promised stronger global institutions to prevent this from rec@@ ur@@ ring .
but the FS@@ B is not a treaty @-@ based global regul@@ ator with en@@ for@@ cement powers .
it continues to be a &quot; standard set@@ ter &quot; in a world with strong incentives to ev@@ ade standards and neg@@ ligi@@ ble sanctions for doing so .
fur@@ ther@@ more , although the FS@@ B &apos;s standards are o@@ sten@@ sibly &quot; universal , &quot; it does not represent all countries or have formal mechanisms to in@@ form and consu@@ lt them .
regulators face a S@@ is@@ yp@@ he@@ an task , owing to the absence of strong and consist@@ ent political support for re@@ ining in the financial ti@@ t@@ ans .
a well @-@ re@@ sour@@ ced financial sector inten@@ sively lob@@ bi@@ es the most influ@@ ential governments in global finance .
the reforms of the IMF , another p@@ il@@ lar of global financial management , cannot be implemented until the US Congress appro@@ ves them - and there is no sign of that .
even the new Bas@@ el 3 banking standards have been di@@ l@@ ut@@ ed and post@@ pon@@ ed .
for Brazil , Russia , India , and China , the del@@ ay in re@@ forming the IMF is a serious anno@@ y@@ ance .
they became major contribu@@ tors to the Fund &apos;s emer@@ gency lo@@ an po@@ ol ( the New Ar@@ r@@ ange@@ ments to Bor@@ row ) immediately after the crisis and now provide 15@@ .@@ 5 % of the NA@@ B &apos;s resources .
but the greater vo@@ ice and vot@@ ing power that they were promised - commen@@ sur@@ ate with their status as four of the IMF &apos;s top ten share@@ holders - has not been deli@@ vered .
even the sel@@ ection of the organization &apos;s man@@ aging direc@@ tor remains a European dro@@ it d@@ u s@@ eig@@ neu@@ r .
more seriously , an ast@@ o@@ und@@ ing 8@@ 9@@ .@@ 2 % of the IMF &apos;s General Res@@ our@@ ces Ac@@ coun@@ t is out@@ standing to European countries , with just three countries ( Greece , Portugal , and Ireland ) accoun@@ ting for 6@@ 8 % .
the IMF &apos;s resources are neither adequate nor available to respond to a crisis elsewhere .
similarly , the G @-@ 20 &quot; s ple@@ dge in 2009 to protect the poorest and most fragi@@ le countries and communities from the effects of the crisis remains un@@ fulfi@@ lled .
the World Bank is at the heart of these efforts , because it can po@@ ol risks glob@@ ally and off@@ set the cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of official and private @-@ sector aid flows , which create &quot; don@@ or dar@@ l@@ ings &quot; ( like R@@ w@@ anda ) and &quot; don@@ or or@@ ph@@ ans . &quot;
but , while the Bank has more than doub@@ led its lending relative to the four years pri@@ or to 2008 , this was achieved mostly by front @-@ lo@@ ad@@ ing existing loans .
crisis @-@ hit countries that were not already borro@@ wers were largely left out .
the Bank &apos;s failure to l@@ end to new cli@@ ents partly reflects its slow@@ ness .
even after its lo@@ an cycle had been spe@@ e@@ ded up , the Bank took an average of 1@@ 3.@@ 5 months to appro@@ ve credi@@ ts - a long time for a country to a@@ wait &quot; emer@@ gency &quot; help .
but the Bank is also ham@@ per@@ ed by wor@@ sen@@ ing resource constra@@ ints , as the biggest post @-@ crisis capital in@@ fu@@ sions went to regional development banks .
the African Development Bank &apos;s capital was increased by 200 % , as was the Asian Development Bank &apos;s .
the In@@ ter @-@ American Development Bank go@@ t a 70 % increase .
meanwhile , the World Bank received an increase of 30 % , while its lending arm for the poorest countries , the International Development As@@ soci@@ ation , received an increase of only 18 % .
cru@@ ci@@ ally , it is not obvious that the Bank has &quot; buy @-@ in &quot; from emerging economies , with Brazil , Russia , India , and China , which ple@@ dged significant resources to the IMF , ple@@ d@@ ging only about 1 % of I@@ D@@ A funding .
further exac@@ erb@@ ating the Bank &apos;s financial wo@@ es , its powerful creditors have op@@ ted to &quot; pul@@ l back &quot; its lending in order to protect its resources .
as a result , compared to the regional development banks , the Bank will be lending less to fe@@ e @-@ paying cli@@ ents , who provide income , and eng@@ aging in more &quot; conc@@ ession@@ al lending , &quot; which does not .
the 2008 crisis high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for international cooperation to regul@@ ate finance and mi@@ tig@@ ate the effects of a crisis .
yet the global resources and instru@@ ments needed to manage ( if not a@@ ver@@ t ) the next crisis have not been sec@@ ured .
instead , regions and countries are qui@@ et@@ ly fin@@ ding their own ways to manage finance , create po@@ ol@@ ed emer@@ gency funds , and strengthen development finance - an outcome that her@@ al@@ ds a more frag@@ ment@@ ed and de@@ cent@@ rali@@ zed set of regulatory regimes and a modest de @-@ globalization of finance and aid .
the En@@ d of an Er@@ a in Fin@@ ance
Cambridge - In the world of economics and finance , re@@ volu@@ tions occur ra@@ rely and are often de@@ t@@ ected only in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but what happened on Febru@@ ary 19 can saf@@ ely be called the end of an era in global finance .
on that day , the International Monetary Fund publi@@ shed a policy no@@ te that rever@@ sed its long @-@ held position on capital controls .
taxes and other restrictions on capital inf@@ lows , the IMF &apos;s economists w@@ ro@@ te , can be help@@ ful , and they constitu@@ te a &quot; legitimate part &quot; of policymakers &quot; to@@ ol@@ k@@ it .
re@@ disco@@ vering the common sense that had str@@ ang@@ ely el@@ u@@ ded the Fund for two decades , the report not@@ ed : &quot; logi@@ c suggests that appropri@@ ately designed controls on capital inf@@ lows could us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly comple@@ ment &quot; other policies .
as late as November of last year , IMF Man@@ aging Di@@ rec@@ tor D@@ om@@ ini@@ que Str@@ aus@@ s @-@ K@@ ah@@ n had thro@@ wn c@@ old water on Brazil &apos;s efforts to stem inf@@ lows of specul@@ ative &quot; ho@@ t money , &quot; and said that he would not re@@ commen@@ d such controls &quot; as a standard pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion . &quot;
so Febru@@ ary &apos;s policy no@@ te is a st@@ un@@ ning re@@ vers@@ al - as close as an institution can come to rec@@ an@@ ting without sa@@ ying , &quot; sor@@ ry , we mess@@ ed up . &quot; but it par@@ all@@ els a general shift in economists &quot; opinion .
it is t@@ elling , for example , that S@@ im@@ on Joh@@ n@@ son , the IMF &apos;s chief economist during 2007 @-@ 2008 , has turned into one of the most ar@@ dent supporters of stric@@ t controls on domestic and international finance .
the IMF &apos;s policy no@@ te makes clear that controls on cross @-@ border financial flows can be not only desi@@ rable , but also effective .
this is important , because the traditional argument of last res@@ ort against capital controls has been that they could not be made to sti@@ ck .
financial markets would always ou@@ ts@@ mar@@ t the policymakers .
even if true , ev@@ ad@@ ing the controls requires inc@@ ur@@ ring additional costs to move funds in and out of a country - which is precisely what the controls aim to achieve .
otherwise , why would investors and specul@@ ators c@@ ry b@@ loo@@ dy mur@@ der wh@@ en@@ ever capital controls are men@@ tioned as a possibility ?
if they really cou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t care less , then they sh@@ ou@@ ld@@ n &apos;t care at all .
one justi@@ fication for capital controls is to prevent inf@@ lows of ho@@ t money from boo@@ sting the value of the home currency exc@@ es@@ sively , thereby undermin@@ ing competitiveness .
another is to reduce vulner@@ ability to sud@@ den changes in financial @-@ market senti@@ ment , which can w@@ re@@ ak ha@@ vo@@ c with domestic growth and employment .
to its credit , the IMF not only ackno@@ wle@@ d@@ ges this , but it also provides evidence that developing countries with capital controls were hit less b@@ adly by the fall@@ out from the su@@ b @-@ prime mortgage m@@ elt@@ down .
the IMF &apos;s change of heart is important , but it needs to be followed by further action .
we currently don &apos;t know much about desig@@ ning capital @-@ control regimes .
the t@@ abo@@ o that has att@@ ach@@ ed to capital controls has dis@@ coura@@ ged practi@@ cal , policy @-@ ori@@ ented work that would help governments to manage capital flows directly .
there is some em@@ pi@@ ri@@ cal research on the consequences of capital controls in countries such as Chile , Col@@ om@@ bia , and Malaysia , but very little systemati@@ c research on the appropriate men@@ u of options .
the IMF can help to fi@@ ll the gap .
emerging markets have res@@ or@@ ted to a vari@@ ety of instru@@ ments to limit private @-@ sector borrowing abroad : taxes , un@@ re@@ m@@ uner@@ ated reser@@ ve requirements , quantitative restrictions , and verb@@ al persu@@ asion .
in view of the s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated nature of financial markets , the devi@@ l is often in the deta@@ ils - and what works in one setting is unlikely to work well in others .
for example , Taiwan &apos;s use of administ@@ rative measures that rely heavily on close monit@@ oring of flows may be in@@ appropriate in sett@@ ings where bureau@@ cratic capacity is more limited .
similarly , Chi@@ le@@ an @-@ style un@@ re@@ m@@ uner@@ ated reser@@ ve requirements may be easier to ev@@ ade in countries with exten@@ sive trading in s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated deri@@ v@@ atives .
with the sti@@ g@@ ma on capital controls gone , the IMF should now get to work on developing gui@@ del@@ ines on what kind of controls work best and under what circumstances .
the IMF provides countries with technical assistance in a wide range of areas : monetary policy , bank regulation , and fiscal consolid@@ ation .
it is time to add man@@ aging the capital account to this list .
with this battle won , the next wor@@ thy goal is a global financial trans@@ action tax .
set at a very low level - 0.@@ 0@@ 5 % is a com@@ mon@@ ly men@@ tioned rate - such a tax would raise hundreds of billions of dollars for global public goods while dis@@ coura@@ ging short @-@ term specul@@ ative activities in financial markets .
support for a global financial @-@ trans@@ action tax is growing .
a group of NG@@ Os have rech@@ ri@@ st@@ ened it the &quot; R@@ ob@@ in Ho@@ od tax , &quot; and have launched a global campaign to promote it , complete with a deli@@ ci@@ ously bit@@ ing vi@@ de@@ o cli@@ p feat@@ uring British ac@@ tor Bill Ni@@ gh@@ y ( w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ ro@@ bin@@ ho@@ od@@ tax@@ .@@ or@@ g ) .
significantly , the European Union has thro@@ wn its weight behind the tax and ur@@ ged the IMF to pursue it .
the only major hol@@ d@@ out is the United States , where Treasury Secretary T@@ im Gei@@ th@@ ner has made his di@@ sta@@ ste for the proposal clear .
what made finance so le@@ th@@ al in the past was the combination of economists &quot; ideas with the political power of banks .
the bad news is that big banks re@@ tain significant political power .
the good news is that the intellectual climate has shif@@ ted deci@@ sively against them .
shor@@ n of support from economists , the financial industry will have a much har@@ der time prev@@ enting the fe@@ ti@@ sh of free finance from being to@@ s@@ sed into the du@@ st@@ bin of history .
the En@@ d of Au@@ stri@@ a \ u@@ 0@@ 0@@ 27@@ s So@@ cial Partner@@ ship ?
few changes of government in Europe attrac@@ t sen@@ s@@ ational jour@@ n@@ alism of the type that Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s October 1999 elections - which brought J@@ ör@@ g H@@ ai@@ der &apos;s Fre@@ e@@ dom Party into government - did .
two years later , with the EU sanctions imposed after the government &apos;s formation now li@@ f@@ ted , it is time to ass@@ ess the impact of this government on Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s economy , the field where the ruling coalition &apos;s pre @-@ election rhetoric promised the biggest changes .
to understand what Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s government is doing , it is necessary to understand where Au@@ stri@@ a has been .
Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s economy per@@ formed soli@@ dly throughout the 199@@ 0s , roughly in line with EU and Euro A@@ rea a@@ ver@@ ages .
yet , due to Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s acc@@ ession to the EU in 1995 and the country &apos;s trade and investment in re@@ shap@@ ing neighbor@@ ing economies in Eastern Europe , many Au@@ stri@@ ans expected higher growth .
two factors inc@@ ited Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s lower than expected economic dynami@@ cs : del@@ ay@@ ed fiscal consolid@@ ation and la@@ gg@@ ing structural reforms .
efforts at fiscal consolid@@ ation in the 199@@ 0s were usually followed by wider structural deficits , and although market reforms were discus@@ sed , few were implemented .
both problems contribu@@ ted to the break@@ down of the long @-@ ruling coalition government of So@@ cial Democrats and Con@@ serv@@ atives ( the Vol@@ k@@ spar@@ te@@ i ) .
the Con@@ servative and Fre@@ e@@ dom Party coalition formed after the 1999 elections confron@@ ted a difficult job .
although the program of the coalition partners shared many points , a contra@@ dic@@ tion exist@@ ed concern@@ ing Europe .
by introduc@@ ing more flexi@@ bility in product and labor markets and by commit@@ ting itself to over@@ hau@@ l public sector management , the Con@@ serv@@ atives hop@@ ed that Au@@ stri@@ a would increase its competitiveness and thus achieve higher growth .
in contrast , the Fre@@ e@@ dom Party has never been Pr@@ o @-@ European , at least since 1990 ; nor has it been open to EU acc@@ ession by former communist states in Eastern Europe .
the EU sanctions imposed on Au@@ stri@@ a after the election boo@@ sted the Fre@@ e@@ dom Party by attrac@@ ting anti @-@ European senti@@ ments within Au@@ stri@@ a to it .
as a consequ@@ ence , it remains un@@ clear whether or not Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s current government looks at Europe and EU expansion e@@ ast@@ ward as a basis on which to secure a better international profi@@ le and added growth .
early on in its ten@@ ure , the coalition government initi@@ ated a stability program designed to elimin@@ ate the government &apos;s deficit by 2002 .
this goal may be achieved this year , mainly by raising revenues in the form of higher indi@@ rec@@ t taxes ( e@@ .@@ g@@ . , le@@ vi@@ es on electricity , increases on the v@@ ehi@@ cle insurance tax , to@@ b@@ acc@@ o tax , as well as by introduc@@ ing tu@@ i@@ tion fe@@ es at universities ) . stric@@ ter corporate taxes were also adopted .
on the expendi@@ ture side , structural measures were implemented , not@@ ably pension reform as well as ph@@ ased reduc@@ tions in government employment and a more focused targe@@ ting of social transfers .
but these expendi@@ ture re@@ stra@@ ints are oc@@ curr@@ ing only slow@@ ly , which means that the stability program is front @-@ lo@@ ad@@ ed with an increased tax burden reaching unprecedented levels .
these steps towards a balanced budget were , in part , coura@@ ge@@ ous because they sti@@ r@@ red up resistance by the people and institutions affected .
some measures were well @-@ designed , such as reform of the state pension system ( although a need for further reform remains ) - while others , such as the measures aimed at raising revenues and reducing costs in the health care system , were too h@@ as@@ ti@@ ly implemented - e@@ .@@ g@@ . the new system of health co @-@ payments requires re@@ desig@@ n .
moreover , so far , health care reform has failed to yi@@ eld the savings that were expected .
the new government also began to change broad areas of public administration .
it reduced government employment , gran@@ ted only moderate wage increases and s@@ las@@ h@@ ed public investment .
all this helped consolid@@ ate the budget but created a climate of opposition .
administ@@ rative reforms norm@@ ally require me@@ ti@@ cul@@ ous pre@@ par@@ ation , which the government tried to generate quickly through a study conduc@@ ted by the T@@ ask Reform Commission , which was publi@@ shed in March 2001 .
so far , sug@@ ges@@ tions as to how to raise public sector efficiency are num@@ erous , but legisl@@ ative initiatives , based on the Commission &apos;s sug@@ ges@@ tions , are r@@ are or have not been worked out satis@@ fac@@ t@@ ori@@ ly .
ad@@ mit@@ tedly , it is politically difficult to turn government agencies into more entrep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al un@@ its .
past experience in Au@@ stri@@ a has shown few positive exam@@ ples .
one reason may be that entrep@@ ren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al sp@@ in @-@ off@@ s were often created with un@@ reali@@ stic goals and without any th@@ or@@ ough analy@@ ses of the expected benefits and costs .
in 2000 and 2001 , many state hol@@ dings in industry were privati@@ zed , sharply reducing the debt position of the mo@@ ther company of the nation@@ alized industries ( Ö@@ I@@ A@@ G ) .
its debts stem from a decision , taken by the old coalition government , where@@ by the losses of nation@@ alized industries were assum@@ ed by the state .
in addition to continued privati@@ zation , many policy measures were initi@@ ated by the new government that aimed to improve the func@@ tioning of the market : e@@ .@@ g@@ . , opening the electricity and gas markets to competition ahead of other EU countries , opening the tel@@ ec@@ om@@ m@@ unic@@ ation sector , strengthening equity markets through changes in the tax system , uni@@ fication of financial market super@@ vision and other measures .
despite these reforms , many inf@@ le@@ xi@@ bi@@ lities remain .
for example , sho@@ p opening @-@ hours still must comp@@ ly with highly restric@@ tive rules .
indeed , within the OECD , Au@@ stri@@ a reta@@ ins one of the ti@@ gh@@ test reta@@ il sector regulations .
many labor market inf@@ le@@ xi@@ bi@@ lities also per@@ sist .
but a deeper question about the nature of Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s political / economic system remains un@@ ans@@ wer@@ ed .
Au@@ stri@@ a &apos;s economic success and political stability after World War II was pre@@ mis@@ ed on a system of social partner@@ ship .
economic policy was often determined by the four social partners : the Ch@@ am@@ ber of Com@@ mer@@ ce , the associ@@ ation of Ch@@ am@@ bers of A@@ gri@@ culture , the Ch@@ am@@ ber of Lab@@ or , and the Au@@ stri@@ an Trade Union .
the first are associated with the Con@@ serv@@ atives , the lat@@ ter two with the So@@ cial Democrats .
the formation of the Con@@ servative / Fre@@ e@@ dom Party coalition government called that partner@@ ship into question .
the short @-@ term consequences of this may not be negative , since it was a lack of agreement among the social partners that caused the structural problems of the 199@@ 0s to go un@@ resol@@ ved .
so the current government &apos;s efforts to resolve them may be help@@ ful . but the long @-@ term consequences of a break@@ down in the social partner@@ ship remain un@@ known .
given that social partner@@ ship deli@@ vered stability and prosperity to Au@@ stri@@ a for decades , it must be hop@@ ed that today &apos;s changes serve as a cat@@ aly@@ st for rene@@ wed social consensus .
the En@@ d of Bank@@ s ?
Bar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a ­ - Ar@@ e banks do@@ om@@ ed as a result of the current financial crisis ?
the sec@@ uri@@ ti@@ zation of mortg@@ ages origin@@ ally was seen as a tri@@ ump@@ h , because it shif@@ ted risk to financial markets , while taking deposi@@ ts and making and monit@@ oring loans - the pur@@ view of traditional banks - was regar@@ ded as nar@@ row and old @-@ fas@@ hi@@ oned .
by contrast , modern banks would seek finance mainly in the inter@@ bank market and sec@@ uri@@ ti@@ ze their lo@@ an port@@ foli@@ os .
in theory , such banks should be imm@@ un@@ e to r@@ uns , because the inter@@ bank market is supposed to be extrem@@ ely efficient , and risk would be shif@@ ted to investors willing to bear it .
deposi@@ ts would be re@@ placed by mu@@ tual funds , which , as we know , are also imm@@ un@@ e to r@@ uns , and the risk of struc@@ tured investment v@@ ehi@@ cles ( Si@@ v &apos;s ) would be assess@@ ed ac@@ cur@@ ately by r@@ ating agencies .
all this financial engine@@ ering would avoid the ob@@ sol@@ ete capital requirements that burden banks &quot; operation .
the current crisis killed off this optimi@@ stic scenario .
the inter@@ bank market has almost collap@@ sed , because banks do not trust each other in the same way that we tend not to trust an e@@ ager s@@ eller of a second @-@ hand c@@ ar .
this is a tex@@ t@@ book market failure .
the ori@@ gin of the problem is uncertainty about banks &quot; ex@@ pos@@ ure to su@@ b @-@ prime mortg@@ ages , the risks of which have been ca@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly assess@@ ed by r@@ ating agencies due to conflicts of interest .
nor@@ thern Ro@@ ck in the United Kingdom has been a victi@@ m of this modern banking strategy , as has Be@@ ar Ste@@ ar@@ ns in the United States .
others may follow soon .
moreover , institutions that thought they had trans@@ fer@@ red risk to the market reali@@ zed that the de@@ mise of sp@@ on@@ so@@ red Si@@ v &apos;s would damage their rep@@ ut@@ ations ir@@ re@@ versi@@ bly .
this imp@@ lied that they had to res@@ c@@ ue these Si@@ v &apos;s .
al@@ as , they failed to set asi@@ de enough capital for this un@@ fo@@ rese@@ en contin@@ gency , and external investors such as the sovereign wealth funds of China , Singap@@ ore , and the Middle East have had to come to the res@@ c@@ ue .
finally , mu@@ tual funds are at risk as well , because their sup@@ pos@@ edly safe investments may s@@ our and the insurance that b@@ acks them now appears sha@@ k@@ y .
the su@@ b @-@ prime con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ation of money market funds would prove disa@@ stro@@ us , with consequences far beyond what we have seen up to now .
the supposed transfer of risk would turn out to have been a mi@@ ra@@ ge .
are banks , markets , or regulators to blame ?
the answer may indic@@ ate what future a@@ wa@@ its banks .
some regulators were ir@@ responsible for not anti@@ cip@@ ating the rational profi@@ t @-@ ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing behavior of institutions with a limited li@@ ability char@@ ter and of exec@@ uti@@ ves effectively prot@@ ected from failure .
after all , what should banks do when , instead of keeping su@@ b @-@ prime mortg@@ ages on their boo@@ ks , monit@@ oring their performance , and inc@@ ur@@ ring capital requirements , they can sec@@ uri@@ ti@@ ze them advanta@@ ge@@ ously ( because the r@@ ating agencies have a stak@@ e in the business ) , avoid capital requirements , and profi@@ t from investors &quot; in@@ experience with such products .
indeed , even if things turned u@@ g@@ ly and banks &quot; equity suffer@@ ed , exec@@ uti@@ ves k@@ new that their own gener@@ ous bon@@ uses and pension pack@@ ages most likely would not .
given this , regulators should have thought twi@@ ce before per@@ mit@@ ting off @-@ balance she@@ et operations without any further provi@@ sion .
the fundamental question today is who monit@@ ors op@@ a@@ que loans , whether of the su@@ b @-@ prime or any other vari@@ ety .
tradition@@ ally , the answer was banks ; in the sec@@ uri@@ ti@@ zed world , it remains a question .
so , is there an alternative to the old @-@ fas@@ hi@@ oned monit@@ oring of loans by banks ?
perhaps if those sec@@ uri@@ ti@@ zed pack@@ ages had been proper@@ ly r@@ ated , the origin@@ ating institution would be ob@@ li@@ ged to re@@ tain a share to sign@@ al to the market that risk was being controlled .
and , clearly , the idea that capital requirements were not needed for banks &quot; off @-@ balance she@@ et activities ( because the banks were not be@@ aring the risk ) , was simply wrong .
appropriate regulation - including regulation of r@@ ating agencies - would most likely make traditional banks popular again .
a re@@ consider@@ ation of banks &quot; limited li@@ ability char@@ ter would go even further in rest@@ oring credibility .
the principle is simple : when your own money is at stak@@ e , you tend to be care@@ ful .
but when you can play with others &quot; money and expect a very high re@@ ward for success and no puni@@ shment for failure , the incentives for ir@@ responsible risk @-@ taking become enormous .

but , according to the US Treasury De@@ par@@ tment , over@@ se@@ as investors sol@@ d a record $ 5@@ 4.@@ 5 billion in long @-@ term US debt in April of this year , with China s@@ las@@ h@@ ing its hol@@ dings by $ 5@@ .@@ 4 billion .
this du@@ mp@@ ing of US government debt by foreign investors her@@ al@@ ds the end of an era of che@@ ap financing for the US .
as it stands , the US government hol@@ ds roughly 40 % of its debt through the Federal Reserve and government agencies like the So@@ cial Security Tru@@ st Fund , while American and foreign investors hold 30 % each .
emerging economies - many of which use large trade sur@@ pl@@ uses to drive GDP growth and sup@@ ple@@ ment their foreign @-@ exchange reserves with the resulting capital inf@@ lows - are leading bu@@ yers of US debt .
over the last decade , these countries &quot; foreign @-@ exchange reserves have s@@ w@@ ell@@ ed from $ 7@@ 50 billion to $ 6@@ .@@ 3 trillion - more than 50 % of the global total - providing a major source of financing that has effectively sup@@ pressed long @-@ term US borrowing costs .
with yi@@ elds on US ten @-@ year bonds falling by 45 % annually , on average , from 2000 to 2012 , the US was able to finance its debt on exc@@ ep@@ tion@@ ally favor@@ able terms .
but the ongoing de@@ preci@@ ation of the US dollar - which has fallen by almost half since the B@@ ret@@ ton Wo@@ ods system collap@@ sed in 197@@ 1 - together with the rising vol@@ ume of US government debt , undermin@@ es the purch@@ asing power of investors in US government securities .
this di@@ mini@@ sh@@ es the value of these countries &quot; foreign @-@ exchange reserves , end@@ ang@@ ers their fiscal and exchange @-@ rate policies , and undermin@@ es their financial security .
no@@ where is this more problemati@@ c than in China , which , despite the recent sell @-@ off , remains by far America &apos;s largest foreign credi@@ tor , accoun@@ ting for more than 22 % of America &apos;s foreign @-@ held debt .
Chinese demand for Treas@@ uries has enab@@ led the US to increase its government debt almost thre@@ e@@ fol@@ d over the last decade , from roughly $ 6 trillion to $ 16@@ .@@ 7 trillion .
this , in turn , has fu@@ eled a roughly 28 % annual expansion in China &apos;s foreign @-@ exchange reserves .
China &apos;s purch@@ ases of American debt effectively trans@@ fer@@ red the official reserves gained via China &apos;s trade surplus back to the US market .
in early 2000 , China held only $ 7@@ 1.@@ 4 billion of US debt and accoun@@ ted for 8 % of total foreign investment in the US .
by the end of 2012 , this fig@@ ure had reached $ 1.@@ 2 trillion , accoun@@ ting for 22 % of in@@ ward foreign investment .
but China &apos;s reserves have long suffer@@ ed as a result , yi@@ el@@ ding only 2 % on US ten @-@ year bonds , when they should be yi@@ el@@ ding 3 @-@ 5 % .
meanwhile , out@@ ward foreign direct investment yi@@ elds 20 % annually , on average .
so , whereas China &apos;s $ 3 trillion in foreign @-@ exchange reserves will yi@@ eld only about $ 100 billion annually , its $ 1.@@ 5@@ 3 trillion in foreign direct investment could bring in annual returns tot@@ aling around $ 300 billion .
despite such low returns , China has continued to invest its reserves in the US , largely owing to the in@@ ability of its own under @-@ developed financial market to generate a sufficient supply of safe assets .
in the first four months of this year , China added $ 4@@ 4.@@ 3 billion of US Treasury securities to its reserves , mean@@ ing that such debt now accounts for 3@@ 8 % of China &apos;s total foreign @-@ exchange reserves .
but the growing risk associated with US Treasury bonds should pro@@ mp@@ t China to reduce its hol@@ dings of US debt .
the US Federal Reserve &apos;s announ@@ cement in May that it may wind down its quantitative easing ( QE ) program - that is , large @-@ scale purch@@ ases of long @-@ term financial assets - by the end of this year has sp@@ ark@@ ed fears of a 1994 @-@ style bond @-@ market collapse .
concerns that a sharp rise in interest rates will cause the value of bond port@@ foli@@ os to pl@@ um@@ met have contribu@@ ted to the recent wa@@ ve of foreign investors du@@ mp@@ ing US debt - a trend that is likely to continue to the extent that the Fed follow@@ s through on its exit from QE .
yi@@ elds on ten @-@ year US bonds are now 2.@@ 9@@ 4 % , a 5@@ 8 % increase since the first quarter of this year , causing the interest @-@ rate gap between t@@ wo@@ - and ten @-@ year bonds to wi@@ den to 2@@ 4@@ 8 basis points .
according to the Con@@ gres@@ sional Bud@@ get O@@ ffi@@ ce , the yi@@ eld rate on ten @-@ year bonds will continue to rise , reaching 5 % by 201@@ 9 and rema@@ ining at or above that level for the next five years .
while it is unlikely that this will lead to a 1994 @-@ style disaster , especially given that the current yi@@ eld rate remains very low by historical standards , it will destabili@@ ze the US debt market .
for China , the benefits of holding large quanti@@ ties of US dollars no longer out@@ wei@@ gh the risks , so it must begin to reduce the share of US securities in its foreign @-@ exchange reserves .
given that China will reduce the overall size of its reserves as its population ages and its economic @-@ growth model shif@@ ts toward domestic consumption , a substantial sell @-@ off of US debt is inevitable - and , with it , a large and permanent increase in America &apos;s financing costs .
the En@@ d of China &apos;s S@@ ur@@ plus
Cambridge - China &apos;s current @-@ account surplus - the combination of its trade surplus and its net income from foreign investments - is the largest in the world .
with a trade surplus of $ 19@@ 0 billion and the income from its nearly $ 3 trillion port@@ foli@@ o of foreign assets , China &apos;s external surplus stands at $ 3@@ 16 billion , or 6@@ .@@ 1 % of annual GDP .
because the current @-@ account surplus is den@@ omin@@ ated in foreign currencies , China must use these funds to invest abroad , prim@@ arily by purch@@ asing government bonds issued by the United States and European countries .
as a result , interest rates in those countries are lower than they would otherwise be .
that may all be about to change .
the policies that China will adopt as part of its new five @-@ year plan will shr@@ in@@ k its trade and current @-@ account sur@@ pl@@ uses .
it is possible that , before the end of the decade , China &apos;s current @-@ account surplus will move into deficit , as the country imports more than it exports and sp@@ ends its foreign @-@ investment income on imports rather than on foreign securities .
if that happen@@ s , China will no longer be a net bu@@ yer of US and other foreign bonds , putting up@@ ward pressure on interest rates in those countries .
although this scenario might now seem im@@ plau@@ sible , it is actually quite likely to occur .
after all , the policies that China will implement in the next few years target the country &apos;s enormous saving rate - the cause of its large current @-@ account surplus .
in any country , the current @-@ account balance is the difference between national saving and national investment in plant and equi@@ p@@ ment , housing , and inv@@ ent@@ ories .
this key fact is not a matter of economic theory or an histori@@ c regul@@ ar@@ ity .
it is a fundamental national @-@ income accoun@@ ting identity that must hold for every country in every year .
so any country that redu@@ ces its saving without cutting its investment will see its current @-@ account surplus decline .
China &apos;s national saving rate - including household saving and business saving - is now about 45 % of its GDP , which is the highest rate in the world .
but , looking ahead , the five @-@ year plan will cause the saving rate to decline , as China se@@ eks to increase consumer spending and therefore the standard of living of the average Chinese .
the plan calls for a shift to higher real wages so that household income will rise as a share of GDP .
moreover , state @-@ owned enterpri@@ ses will be required to pay out a larger por@@ tion of their ear@@ nings as divi@@ den@@ ds .
and the government will increase its spending on consumption services like health care , education , and housing .
these policies are motiv@@ ated by domestic consider@@ ations , as the Chinese government se@@ eks to raise living standards more rapidly than the moder@@ ating growth rate of GDP .
their net effect will be to raise consumption as a share of GDP and to reduce the national saving rate .
and with that lower saving rate will come a smaller current @-@ account surplus .
since China &apos;s current @-@ account surplus is now 6 % of its GDP , if the saving rate dec@@ lines from the current 45 % to less than 3@@ 9 % - still higher than any other country - the surplus will become a deficit .
this out@@ look for the current @-@ account balance does not depend on what happen@@ s to the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate against other currencies .
the saving @-@ investment im@@ balance is fundamental , and it alone determin@@ es a country &apos;s external position .
but the fall in domestic saving is likely to cause the Chinese government to allow the renminbi to appreci@@ ate more rapidly .
higher domestic consumer spending would otherwise create in@@ flationary pres@@ sures .
allowing the currency to appreci@@ ate will help to off@@ set those pres@@ sures and re@@ stra@@ in price growth .
a stronger renminbi would reduce the im@@ port bil@@ l , including prices for oil and other production in@@ pu@@ ts , while making Chinese goods more expensive for foreign bu@@ yers and foreign goods more attrac@@ tive to Chinese consumers .
this would cause a shift from exports to production for the domestic market , thereby shr@@ in@@ king the trade surplus , in addition to cur@@ bing inflation .
China &apos;s trade surplus and the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate were high on the list of t@@ op@@ i@@ cs that President H@@ u J@@ inta@@ o and US President Barack Obama discus@@ sed when H@@ u visi@@ ted Washington earlier this month .
the Americans are e@@ ager for China to reduce its surplus and allow its currency to appreci@@ ate more rapidly .
but they should be care@@ ful what they wish for , because a lower surplus and a stronger renminbi imp@@ ly a day when China is no longer a net bu@@ yer of US government bonds .
the US should start plann@@ ing for that day now .
the En@@ d of Fis@@ cal So@@ ver@@ eign@@ ty in Europe
Mil@@ an - The late Mil@@ ton Frie@@ d@@ man said that a common currency - that is , a monetary union - cannot be sustained without a deep form of economic and political union .
by this , he meant an open economy that en@@ sures the free flow of goods , labor , and capital , together with a discipl@@ ined central fiscal authority and a strong central bank .
the lat@@ ter two are p@@ ill@@ ars of a strong currency . they work in tan@@ dem .
but the other pi@@ ec@@ es are no less important .
the eurozone , currently w@@ rest@@ ling with fiscal im@@ balance and sovereign debt risk , has a strong and autonom@@ ous central bank , but is fis@@ cally frag@@ ment@@ ed and only partly uni@@ fied politically .
enter the Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht Treaty , which in theory im@@ poses fiscal discipl@@ ine by plac@@ ing limits on government deficits and debt levels - clearly a structure designed to prevent free ri@@ ding on the fiscal discipl@@ ine of others .
Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht was thus intended to prevent a situation like the current one in Greece .
it did@@ n &apos;t work .
eurozone sovereign debt turned out not to be hom@@ o@@ gen@@ ous with respect to risk .
in a stable world , Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht Treaty &apos;s rules @-@ based framework , if en@@ forced , might do the job .
but in a sho@@ ck @-@ pr@@ one world , it is a fragi@@ le system , because it prec@@ lu@@ des anything but modest counter@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal policy .
no won@@ der , then , that the treaty &apos;s stric@@ t limits were bre@@ ach@@ ed early in the euro &apos;s first decade by@@ core countries as well as peripher@@ al ones .
indeed , with a large sho@@ ck , much of the bre@@ ach happen@@ s automati@@ cally , as tax revenues shr@@ in@@ k and social @-@ insurance payments expand .
recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund suggests that as much as 80 % of the fiscal stimulus in advanced countries during the current crisis is non @-@ dis@@ cre@@ tion@@ ary .
that kind of built @-@ in counter @-@ cy@@ c@@ lic@@ ality is not a bad thing .
but if it produ@@ ces the threat of fiscal instability and excessive sovereign @-@ debt risk after a large sho@@ ck , then the starting point was not suffici@@ ently conservative - in other words , deficits or debt levels ( or both ) were too high .
counter @-@ cy@@ c@@ lic@@ ality does not mean running modest deficits in the good times and huge deficits in major down@@ turns .
if the current EU budget rules are too rigi@@ d and are ig@@ no@@ red in the face of a sho@@ ck , then the do@@ or is open for imp@@ ru@@ dent fiscal behavior .
in theory , stric@@ t in @-@ dep@@ th monit@@ oring could dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish genu@@ in@@ ely p@@ ru@@ dent counter@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal respon@@ ses from prof@@ lig@@ acy .
but in practice it is hard to en@@ force .
the eurozone &apos;s immediate challenge is declining fiscal stability in a sub@@ set of countries whose credit rat@@ ings are falling and debt @-@ service costs rising .
ab@@ sent external assistance and a credible plan for rest@@ oring fiscal order , Greek sovereign debt could not be ro@@ lled over , forcing a default , probably in the form of a restructuring of Greek debt .
even with external assistance , many view default as a near certain@@ ty , because the ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic of rest@@ oring fiscal balance is so da@@ un@@ ting .
eurozone membership prec@@ lu@@ des inflation and de@@ val@@ uation as adjustment mechanisms .
an alternative is domestic deflation combined with extreme fiscal ti@@ ghten@@ ing - that is , a period of slow or negative growth in wages , incomes , and some prices of non @-@ tra@@ ded goods .
but deflation is pain@@ ful and cannot reali@@ sti@@ cally be pursu@@ ed for political reasons .
the constra@@ ints for eurozone countries are similar to those of a state in America that gets into fiscal trou@@ ble .
de@@ val@@ uation is not an option because of the common currency . the Federal Reserve will not will@@ ingly res@@ ort to inflation .
moreover , in the United States , there are rules and conven@@ tions ( similar to Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht ) that dis@@ allow or dis@@ coura@@ ge states from running long @-@ term deficits .
this means that state fiscal behavior ten@@ ds to be pro @-@ cy@@ cli@@ cal in the face of large sho@@ cks like the recent one .
so why is@@ n &apos;t a federal system equally fragi@@ le ?
there are two key safety val@@ ves .
one is the central government &apos;s ability to run deficits and to act deci@@ sively .
the other is labor mo@@ bility .
the EU does not have a robu@@ st cent@@ rali@@ zed fiscal structure with a counter @-@ cy@@ cli@@ cal mandate .
and labor mo@@ bility , a long @-@ run goal in the EU , is constra@@ ined by language , laws , and di@@ verse regulatory regimes .
in addition , state bonds are not tre@@ ated as equ@@ als , and the markets pen@@ alize prof@@ lig@@ ate states .
if the EU wants a monetary union in which sovereign debt is relatively hom@@ o@@ gen@@ ous with respect to risk , fiscal discipl@@ ine must be similarly hom@@ o@@ gen@@ ous .
but that also means that it will need a more robu@@ st mechanism for counter@@ cy@@ cli@@ cal respon@@ ses to sho@@ cks .
the EU &apos;s leaders recently st@@ ated their inten@@ tion to revi@@ si@@ t the Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht structure , which in principle is a good idea .
they might take the rou@@ te of adap@@ ting the Ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht rules to allow for more in@@ ter @-@ tempor@@ al flexi@@ bility at the national level .
but that approach would be complic@@ ated . one would need a s@@ op@@ hi@@ sti@@ c@@ ated cap@@ ability for monit@@ oring and en@@ forcing fiscal policy and sovereign debt - or else end up with a repe@@ at of the current situation .
a better long @-@ term solution is a central EU fiscal capacity that accumul@@ ates the resources to respond to sho@@ cks during peri@@ ods of growth .
one could think of it as a stabili@@ zation tax that becomes negative in down@@ turns .
but a move in this direction does invol@@ ve some degree of fiscal cent@@ rali@@ zation .
