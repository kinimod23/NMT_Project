Critics who want a more activist, growth-oriented monetary policy have tried--albeit unsuccessfully--to soften up the 68-year-old Dutchman with personal attacks and degrading insults.
But the ECB head and the Governing Council refused to yield either to insults or to heavy-handed political pressure to cut interest rates, cut them again, and then cut them some more.
The fledgling bank earned enormous credibility, but also considerable enmity, by sticking to its anti-inflation mandate. 
Of course, the ECB has had its problems--mainly in the communications area--and Duisenberg's candor sometimes did get him into trouble.
But these were small matters that were vastly distorted by critics with their own agendas for the bank.
Whatever problems may have existed in the early years--too many voices, too little clarity of message--were smoothed out over time. 
In a recent personal interview in his Frankfurt office, I asked Duisenberg what had been his single most important accomplishment in office.
Without hesitation he responded that it was the smooth introduction and easy acceptance of the common currency.
Now it can be told that the central bank had 25 to 30 disaster scenarios ready in case things went badly.
None, in fact, was needed.
The introduction of the euro currency was accomplished more smoothly than even the ECB had expected. 
But it was no single accomplishment that made Duisenberg's term in office a success.
Rather, it was his consensual style of leadership.
Forging twelve independent, proud, and, in some cases, powerful national central banks into a cohesive collective was no easy task.
It would not have been possible with an authoritarian personality at the ECB helm. 
There is a myth now making the rounds that the search for consensus slowed down the ECB's decision-making process when setting monetary policy.
But the ECB was "slow" to cut rates not because of the need for consensus, but because it is a non-activist bank that cuts rates only when the inflation picture justifies it.
According to Mr. Duisenberg, there was not a single instance when an important monetary policy decision was delayed because of the need for consensus. 
Notwithstanding the ECB's significant achievements during the Duisenberg years, important problems remain for the new president, Jean-Claude Trichet of France.
The promise of the euro--that it would set off a competitive dynamic inside the euro-zone economy that would compel structural reform--has yet to be fulfilled.
So far, Europe's politicians have resisted reform, and scarcely an opportunity went by that Wim Duisenberg didn't scold Europe's politicians for this failure. 
The Growth and Stability Pact (which mandates a 3% of GDP limit on the size of the budget deficits of euro-zone members) is another contentious issue that awaits resolution.
Controversy over the Pact has set off a nasty dispute between small and big countries in the euro-zone. 
There are well-founded complaints about double standards.
The small countries follow the rules but the big countries act as if they are exempt.
According to Nout Wellink, president of the Dutch Central Bank, failure to satisfactorily settle this issue could have serious negative consequences for the euro. 
Finally--and perhaps most important--is the problem of integrating the economies of the ten new member states into the euro area.
This will not be easy.
The bank must be careful not to bite off more than it can chew. 
Wim Duisenberg's appointment as first ECB president in May 1998 was mired in political controversy.
But as he exits his post, there is a growing consensus that history will record the straight-talking Dutchman as being the right man for the right job at the right time.
He deserves Europe's unequivocal gratitude for launching the ECB so successfully. 
The Dutch Jobs Miracle
PARIS: Unemployment in the Netherlands dipped below 3% recently, a figure for the most part unheard of in Europe since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
Indeed, not so long ago unemployment in the Netherlands stood above 10%.
Have the Dutch invented a Fourth Way to improved economic performance and are there lessons for the rest of Europe in the Dutch experience?
For some observers across Europe, the economic performance of the Netherlands is so surprising that they believe it a product of smoke and mirrors, or of some statistical trick.
But as with those who doubted the reality behind American economic growth five years ago, this view is also emphatically wrong.
Not only is unemployment way down in the Netherlands, but the rate of participation by the entire population in the labour market is growing sharply as well.
True, the proportion of workers who remain classified by the state as sick or invalid - currently 12% - remains much too high, to be frank.
But this proportion is less today than it was in the 1980s; so a higher unemployment rate is not being disguised by medical certificates.
Other disbelieving observers say that what we are seeing in the Netherlands is the effect of a shortening of the work week.
The average work week in the Netherlands (counting both those who work full-time and those who work part-time) is 27 hours, compared to 29 hours in France.
Advocates of a shorter work week as the road to full employment, indeed, often cite the Dutch example to declare victory for their arguments.
Those against a shortened work week, however, dismiss the increase in the number of jobs that results from shorter working hours as a false solution - a crude swap of working hours for an increase in the number of workers.
Both hostile camps are wrong.
There is a significant increase in part-time work in the Netherlands, to be sure, but it is due, primarily, to a large increase in labor participation among women.
Thus part-time work does not mechanically explain the country's lower unemployment rate.
So what is the secret of successful job creation in the Netherlands?
The immediate reason is easy to identify.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, wage increases have been smaller than technological progress would have allowed.
Company profits have thus gone up, leading to new investment and the creation of new jobs.
This is a classic mechanism, but one which has worked perfectly.
The more delicate question is to identify those factors that made wage moderation in the Netherlands possible.
I see two principal reasons:
• The first is a reform of unemployment insurance. The Netherlands has put into effect a reform that links unemployment compensation to searching for a new job.
Refusal by an unemployed person to take an "acceptable" job offer automatically results in the end of state support for him or her.
The longer an individual remains unemployed, the wider the definition of what constitutes an "acceptable" becomes.
In practice what this means is that an unemployed person must accept a "comparable" job for the first six months of unemployment, and must take any job on offer after eighteen months on the dole or lose state benefits.
• The second factor is cooperation among social partners.
The Dutch harp on this point, but they are right.
For at the root of the Dutch miracle lies the by now quasi-mythological Wassenaar Agreement, signed in 1982, among employers, unions, and the government.
At the time, it was clear to all concerned that the Dutch economy was in bad shape.
The Wassenaar Agreement was a plan of action: moderation of wage demands was assured in exchange for measures designed to alleviate the human cost of unemployment, from the financing of early retirement to the shortening of the work week.
By and large, this strategy has been adhered to ever since.
Important lessons are to be found in the Dutch experience for all of Europe.
Today, economic conditions in Western Europe are good - in some places, better than that even - and they are improving in many countries of Eastern Europe that are seeking EU membership.
But Europe's economies are regularly subject to new recessions.
These recessions will require painful adjustments.
Without a mechanism for social cooperation, the adjustments that any recession will impose are likely to result in high unemployment.
With a solid mechanism of social cooperation, however, there is at least a chance to avoid it.
It is now, when economies are doing better, that such a structure for social cooperation must be considered and constructed.
The Dutch Labor Market Fudge Creates Jobs
AMSTERDAM: The Dutch like to think of themselves as leaders in social policy.
But as we discovered on a recent trip to the Netherlands and Germany, it is in economic policy that today's Europe looks to Holland for leadership.
With unemployment in Germany, France and Italy around 10%, the Dutch jobless rate, at less than 3%, is the envy of Europe.
Holland is that rare example of a booming welfare state ("overheating" was the word used to describe the Dutch economy by three central bankers in Frankfurt).
How did this happen?
Some credit the so-called "Polder Model" of social cooperation between employers, unions and the government.
They're wrong.
Social cooperation per se did not save the Dutch from the mistakes of the 60"s and 70"s.
So how can it be credited for economic recovery in the mid 80"s and 90"s?
True, Dutch trade unions have moderated wage demands. But this is not what sparked Holland's dramatic employment gains.
Instead, credit structural reforms in the Dutch labor market for the jobs boom.
Primary amongst these is the widespread use of part-time and temporary employees.
The move to part-time employment in Holland was intended to increase female participation in the Dutch labor force.
Increasing availability of part-time and temporary jobs, however, raised the labor force participation rates of both men and women.
Regular full-time employees are almost impossible to sack under Dutch law, but employers can fire part-time workers and not renew temporary contracts when they expire.
There is an "iron law" of employment: If employers can't fire workers, they won't hire them.
Ironically, employment boomed in Holland, precisely because an increasing proportion of the work force - made up of part-time and temporary workers - can be fired if necessary.
Among the Euro-11 countries, Holland was the first to both understand this point and act upon it.
Yet Holland has not gone all the way.
An extraordinarily high proportion of the labor force - 12% - is officially classified as "sick" or "invalid" because putting a worker on disability is practically the only way Dutch employers have of ridding their firms of unwanted full-time employees.
Such finagling is costly to business, government and the employees themselves.
So, while still extremely low for continental Europe, the official Dutch unemployment rate underestimates the true level of joblessness in the Dutch economy, because it excludes the disguised unemployment of the "sick" and "disabled."
Were Dutch law to permit the sacking of full time employees (not likely in these prosperous times) the proportion of the work force officially sanctioned as too sick or disabled to work would dramatically decline, as would the number of part-time and temporary workers.
The ability to fire workers not only means less unemployment but more flexible labor markets.
The movement of workers from low to higher productivity uses - whether from firm-to-firm, sector-to-sector or region-to-region - is thwarted if employers do not have the power to sack.
This is not an issue of class struggle, but of economic growth.
US Fed Chairman Greenspan asked recently, "why U.S. businesses and workers appear to have benefitted more from the recent advances in information technology than their counterparts in Europe and Japan?"
His answer: "the relatively inflexible and, hence, more costly labor markets of these economies appears to be a significant part of the explanation... Europe has participated in the wave of invention and innovation, but appears to have been slower to exploit it."
What Greenspan suggests is that the labor market flexibility gap between the US and Europe may be more important in explaining relative economic performance than the alleged technology gap.
There appears to be a right way, a wrong way, and a Dutch way of doing things.
The US does labor market policy the right way.
Continental Europe, excluding Holland, does it the wrong way.
And the Dutch, neither right nor wrong, temper ideology with practicality to forge compromises that have consensus support.
Although this system works for the Dutch, can it work for the rest of Europe?
Why not?
Politically, no European country can - or really wants to - adopt the American model.
At the same time, there is a growing demand in Europe for better economic performance.
European unemployment rates are unacceptably high; America's long boom puts pressure on domestic politicians to do better.
The Dutch solution best fits Europe's present political realities: Keep welfare rules in place, but give people the chance to get around them.
The Dutch retain the job-killing laws that make it impossible to sack regular full-time employees, but allow employers to sack part-time and temporary workers.
This fudge, not social cooperation, is the true "Dutch model" for success.
The Dutch solution can work for other European countries.
In fact, it already has.
When the French changed their labor law to mandate the 35 hour work week, heavy restrictions on the use of part-time and temporary employees by French employers were removed.
This explains the recent upsurge in French job creation.
Superficially, France looks as if it has become more of a welfare state, but the reality is that the French have mimicked the Dutch in increasing labor market flexibility.
This Dutch solution may be second best, but in Europe it's the only alternative that works.
The Dynamism of Nations
Proposals for economic reform of Continental Europe keep coming.
The process does not constitute a unified, reasoned debate so much as an ongoing political auction in which special interests seek votes for the policy change that will benefit them.
Some say the bar to a good economy is the Continent's inflated welfare state and the solution is retrenchment, beginning with raising retirement ages.
Others say the impediment is the entire overgrown public sector and the solution is to cut tax rates.
The latest view, endorsed by the European Commission, blames a shortage of infrastructure and proposes more bridges and tunnels.
This approach will never reach the heart of the matter.
The West's core social values make high economic performance a moral imperative like free speech or trial by jury.
Further, the Continent will undoubtedly need some transformative changes of its economic institutions to establish high-performance economies.
To reach broad agreement on those changes requires facing some basic questions so far ignored.
A real debate on basic reform has to start with an explicit conception of economic performance - of what constitutes a good business life.
Productivity is an important element.
Only a high-productivity economy can promise all or most working-age persons a range of careers at high wage rates.
But high productivity is not the only element of high performance.
The other element is thriving, prospering participants.
This requires jobs to be rewarding in more than pecuniary ways - enlisting the minds of employees, engaging them in problem solving, leading them to discover some of their talents and expanding their abilities.
This personal growth, while an end in itself, is also a source of job satisfaction, which in turn boosts participation in the labor force, and of high employee loyalty, which lowers unemployment, making more good jobs available.
What is needed for high performance?
Basically, it is productive change, which I call economic dynamism .
For employees to develop, they must be imbedded in a stimulating workplace, with new problems to solve, harder tasks to be mastered, added abilities to strive for.
Less obviously, a country does not want misguided or pointless change; it wants investments that appear to the financial sector as productive.
The late 1990's produced evidence that low dynamism was associated with weak economic performance, particularly low prosperity.
Of the 12 large OECD economies, three--Germany, Italy, and France--were conspicuously un-dynamic: they missed the 1990's investment boom or were awfully late to it.
These same economies also ranked at or near the bottom in unemployment and labor-force participation, both before the boom and now.
What are the requirements for dynamism?
Yale University's Robert Shiller has suggested that I believe that Europeans lack dynamism owing to a deficiency of entrepreneurial "spirit."
I have pondered the expressed uneasiness of Europeans about making money, and speculated that their schooling might drain away some playfulness and creativity. But that is not my explanation of Europe's problem.
For one thing, it is hard to decide whether such cultural patterns are causes or effects of dynamic economies.
My thesis is that the degree of dynamism in a nation's economy hinges on its development of some key economic institutions - company law and corporate governance, the population's preparation for business life, the development of financial instruments such as the stock market and so forth. Such general institutions as the rule of law and provision of enough personal and national security to safeguard earning, saving and investing are needed for any market economy, even market socialism; they are insufficient for dynamism.
Evidence exists for this thesis.
One could have predicted in advance of the recent boom how the 12 large OECD economies would rank simply by knowing the percentage of the population with a university degree, the OECD index of barriers to entrepreneurs, and the breadth of the stock exchange (measured by the market value of outstanding shares relative to GDP years before the boom).
This evidence linking employment to dynamism and tracing dynamism to favorable institutions, such as a well-developed stock market, and to obstructive institutions, such as myriad licenses for entry by new firms, is an advance in our understanding of healthy economies.
It is useful to know that there is vastly more to creating economic dynamism than private property; and that high unemployment is not to be laid solely to labor market restrictions.
Is there evidence directly associating high performance - that is, high employment and high productivity - with the presence of institutions believed helpful to dynamism and the absence of those believed harmful?
Such evidence emerges even with the small sample of just 12 large OECD economies.
A cross-country analysis estimates that university education is good for all three elements of economic performance: the employment rate (relative to the working-age population), the unemployment rate (relative to labor force), and labor productivity too.
Scoring high on the OECD index of barriers to entrepreneurs is bad for all three elements of performance.
A high level of job protection is bad for productivity but does not have a clear effect on either employment rate or unemployment rate.
I have suggested that the organizational structure of the Continental economies limits their performance.
This corporatist structure - labor unions, workers councils, employer confederations, and big banks - facilitates direct interventions in economic decision making to give interest groups protection and veto power.
In fact, among the 12 large OECD nations, a higher degree of corporatism as commonly measured is loosely associated with lower employment and lower productivity.
The reason for these negative effects appears to be that high corporatism is strongly correlated with stifled entrepreneurship and obstructive job protection.
The corporatist structure by itself does not detract from performance.
Here again, the truth lies in the nuances.
This is precisely why Europe should be debating about the Continent's real problems, not locking their economies into corporatism by enshrining the "social market economy" into the emerging EU constitution.
The Eagle, the Peacock, and the Taliban
The East Asian Miracle Revisited
HONG KONG - Almost two decades ago, the World Bank published its landmark study The East Asian Miracle, analyzing why East Asian economies grew faster than emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere.
These economies, the study concluded, achieved high growth rates by getting the basics right, promoting investment, nurturing human capital, and opening up to export manufacturing.
But that was not all.
The World Bank also acknowledged, grudgingly, that governments intervened - systematically and through multiple channels - to foster development, including in specific industries in specific locations via subsidies, tax incentives, and financial repression.
In the intervening years, particularly after the Asian Financial Crisis, the pro-market, anti-intervention Washington Consensus fell out of favor.
A "New Institutional Economics" (NIE) gained ground by filling in the gaps left by mainstream models, which ignored the central importance of institutions in managing the change and uncertainty that affect resource allocation and social choice.
Indeed, in light of today's Great Recession and the current European debt crisis, the main question remains that of the role of the state in promoting growth and development.
It was the collapse of the Soviet bloc's planned economies that spurred both free-market hubris and the realization that institutions matter.
But it was China's ability to sustain rapid economic growth for three decades that necessitated a revisionist look at statist capitalism.
Nobel laureate economist Douglass North argued early on that human society created institutions to deal with information asymmetry, but that their creations immediately gave rise to the problem of how to constrain such institutions to fulfill their intended objectives.
In 2000, Oliver E. Williamson classified four levels of social analysis for institutions - informal institutions, customs, traditions, norms, and religion; formal institutions with rules governing property rights, social order, the judiciary, and the bureaucracy; governance structures and their alignment to economize on transaction costs; and decentralized decision-making in resource allocation (the domain of neo-classical economics).
According to Williamson, NIE is primarily concerned with the economic and political ramifications of formal rules and governance structures.
But, for many emerging economies, it is the embeddedness of informal rules, norms, and beliefs, and their slowness to change, that prevents many economies" breakthrough to more advanced, knowledge-based growth.
Francis Fukuyama's new book The Origins of Political Order attempts to address this problem.
He examines the emergence of three categories of political institutions - the state, the rule of law, and accountable government, the latter two being constraints on the state that prevent it from becoming despotic.
Fukuyama argues that patrimonialism - defined as the natural human propensity to favor family and friends - is the bane of the rule of law and accountable government.
But, while patrimonialism may well be the main barrier to countries" advance to middle-class democracy - and a key reason for autocratic states" fragility - it may also be a more general feature of all political and economic systems.
Witness the current debate about whether governments in advanced economies have been captured by financial interests - a question that Gillian Tett poses in a recent review article in Foreign Affairs. "Should governments rein in finance to crush the elite," she asks, "or should they simply accept income differentials and financial savings as the inevitable price of dynamic societies?"
This is not a trivial question, given the role of unabated inequality in growing social unrest and even revolution around the world.
Indeed, the real surprise is that protests such as "Occupy Wall Street" have resulted in so little change, suggesting that institutions, once established, are "sticky" in preserving the status quo.
This is particularly relevant to Asia's growth story.
Former British colonies like India and Malaysia inherited common law and institutional checks and balances, but several today confront institutional decay, rising corruption, and creeping patrimonialism.
Other economies, such as China, are seeking ways to establish the rule of law by strengthening the institutional framework within the framework of one-party rule.
Both Fukuyama and North conclude that strong state-led economies can be accountable, but become fragile should the ruling elites fail to respond to popular majorities and to global norms of behavior and governance.
North argues that competition is a key force driving adaptive efficiency among institutions.
A basic insight of NIE is that measuring transaction costs in various factor and product markets can reveal inefficiencies and barriers to better performance.
An examination of transaction costs in global and domestic supply chains would reveal the extent to which rent-seeking activities and policy distortions deter the emergence of competitive markets.
For advanced economies, the study of Williamson's levels two and three - formal institutions and their governance - can lead to important insights.
But, for emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere, we are convinced that the study of informal institutions, behavior, and norms offers a better understanding of the challenges of managing growth and performance.
Simply put, in many emerging markets, it is not a lack of understanding of international best practices that holds back economic performance.
Rather, it is the conflict between these practices and traditional or domestic social relations and practices that entrench vested interests opposed to change.
The East Asian Triangle
Once again, North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons is threatening Asia's stability.
Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, hastily arranged a summit in China with President Hu Jintao on the eve of North Korea's nuclear test, a meeting that saw both men agree that such a move was "intolerable."
The meeting is a welcome development.
But Abe comes into office with a reputation as a stronger nationalist than his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, whose insistence on visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine (where Class A war criminals from World War II are buried) helped sour relations with China.
For stability to be preserved, Sino-Japanese relations must improve.
Although North Korea's nuclear ambitions are worrying and destabilizing, China's rise is the key strategic issue in East Asia.
For three decades, its economy has grown by 8% to 10% annually.
Its defense expenditures have an even faster pace.
Yet Chinese leaders speak of China's "peaceful rise" and "peaceful development."
Some believe that China cannot rise peacefully, and will seek hegemony in East Asia, leading to conflict with the United States and Japan.
Others point out that China has engaged in "good neighbor" policies since the 1990"s, settled border disputes, played a greater role in international institutions, and recognized the benefits of using soft power.
A decade ago, I oversaw preparation of the US Pentagon's East Asian Strategy Report , which has guided American policy under the Clinton and Bush administrations.
Back then, there was a debate between those who wanted to contain China's growing strength increased and those who urged China's integration into the international system.
Containment was unfeasible, because, unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China's neighbors did not see it as a clear and present danger.
Moreover, treating China as an enemy would ensure that it became one, thus unnecessarily ignoring the possibility of benign outcomes.
The strategy we chose was to "balance and integrate."
The East Asian balance of power rested on the triangle of China, Japan, and the US.
By reaffirming the US-Japan security relationship in the Clinton-Hashimoto declaration of 1996, the US helped structure a favorable regional balance.
By simultaneously encouraging China's entry into the World Trade Organization and other institutions, we created incentives for good behavior.
So integration was hedged by realism in case things went wrong.
That strategy has largely worked.
China's military power has increased, but its behavior has been more moderate than it was a decade ago.
China is a long way from posing the kind of challenge to American preponderance that the Kaiser's Germany posed when it surpassed Britain at the beginning of the twentieth century.
The key to military power in today's information age depends on the ability to integrate complex systems of space-based surveillance, high speed computers, and "smart" weapons.
It is not likely that China (or others) will soon close that gap with the US.
Of course, the fact that China is unlikely to compete with the US on a global basis does not mean that it could not challenge the US in East Asia, or that war over Taiwan is not possible.
If Taiwan were to declare independence, it is likely that China would use force, regardless of the perceived economic or military costs.
But it would be unlikely to win such a war, and prudent policy on all sides can make such a war unlikely.
So what is the strategic problem today?
Stability in East Asia depends upon good relations between all three sides of the US-China-Japan triangle, but ties between China and Japan deteriorated in the Koizumi years.
China permitted demonstrations, sometimes violent, against Japanese consulates in protest of changes in Japanese textbooks that softened descriptions of Japan's invasion in the 1930"s.
After 22 million Chinese signed a petition against Japanese membership of the United Nations Security Council, Premier Wen Jiabao announced China's opposition to such a step.
China also objected to Japanese statements about Taiwan.
And there are territorial disputes about small islands and potential gas reserves near the China-Japan maritime boundary.
The most contentious issue, however, has been prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and, until Abe's visit, China had been reluctant to engage in any summit meetings with Japan so long as such visits continue.
Although China has become Japan's largest partner in trade and foreign direct investment, nationalists in the two countries have fueled each other's extremism, while their governments play with fire.
American interests rest on regional stability and continued growth in trade and investment.
So President George W. Bush could quietly tell Abe that we welcome good relations between Japan and China, and that prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine undercut Japan's own interests in East Asia.
It reminds Asians of the repulsive Japan of the 1930"s rather than the attractive Japan of today.
At the same time, the US can be cautious about involving Japan in Taiwan issues - a neuralgic point for China - while encouraging the development of Asian institutions that increase contacts and dampen conflict.
This can include the development of the East Asian Summit, revival of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the evolution of the current six-party talks on North Korea into a permanent Northeast Asia Security Dialogue.
Fortunately, there are signs that both China and Japan are seeking to back away from the impasse of recent years.
While Abe has maintained his position on Yasukuni, his summit with Chinese President Hu Jintao was a promising step forward.
Some Chinese analysts, for their part, recognize the danger in stimulating too much nationalism toward Japan.
The US should quietly try to nudge these steps forward.
The US-Japan alliance remains crucial to stability in East Asia, but it takes three sides to make a triangle.
The ECB \u0026 Europe\u0027s Upswing
CAMBRIDGE: Europe is on an upswing in growth and euphoria.
But how long can this last?
Showing the nervousness to be expected of a new recruit, the European Central Bank (ECB) has already fired a premature shot at the still hidden figure of inflation.
Will it wait for inflation to really show before firing another volley?
Or will the ECB empty its guns at the first rumblings of a stronger business cycle, fearful of accusations of running from battle or of being caught of guard.
The ECB might surprise everyone by a successful policy of pragmatism, in the manner of the Alan Greenspan led US Federal Reserve Board.
The ECB, however, should not expect to be popular in the way Mr Greenspan is.
It should simply try to be successful.
At this stage, success for the ECB means one thing only: inflation below 2%.
Everything else, including lack of a persistent economic upswing can and should be blamed on Europe's supply side.
Within a year of its establishment the ECB found its way to safe ground: it accepted the advice of Hans Tietmeyer, former head of the Bundesbank, concerning the proper "cruising speed" for Europe's economy.
To keep inflation below 2%, cruising speed cannot exceed 1.5%.
That leaves just enough room for accidents that add to inflation to happen and yet stay below 2%.
Today's upswing is the test.
Coming from a point where inflation is barely over 1%, Europe's upturn will inevitably add to inflation.
The risk of passing to 1.7% in the year ahead motivated the ECB's recent 50 basis point hike.
In capital markets, the commitment to fight inflation, to not be even remotely experimental, was welcomed with a lower long-term rate.
Over the next 6 months we will see how wage rounds are conducted in the new Europe.
To paint the extremes, there are two possibilities.
First, and most optimistically, wage earners throughout the new EMU zone understand the force of permanently fixed exchange rates.
With trade open and unrestricted, with exchange rates gone, labor in each country has lost much, if not all, of its pricing power.
No union can still pretend that it has captive employers who can and will pass wage increases on into prices without reckoning the consequences for profitability and employment.
In this vision of a New European Economy, wage discipline will be stunning.
So, the ECB will encounter no problem of inflation being driven ahead by wages.
Growth can go forward at a significant speed, for wage inflation is no longer an issue.
The pessimistic argument is this: nothing has changed; Germany and France had fixed rates for years; so too Austria, the Netherlands, and Spain.
The only that has changed is that governments are now leftwingish almost everywhere, most dramatically in Germany.
In this view, labor views business as mostly captive, markets as segmented, and the unemployed as generously supported by the State.
So, no more wage moderation; with profits back it is time to get higher wages for workers back, too.
We won't know for a few months which alternative will prevail.
But it helps to look ahead and appreciate the narrow room for maneuver facing the ECB.
With inflation near Tietmeyer's cruising speed, there are only a few tenths of a percent of extra inflation that can be accepted, maybe 1.7 rather than only 1.5%.
Indeed, we can already hear the ECB's refrain: Assuredly, nobody will argue that a an extra one-tenth percent of inflation helps growth; surely everyone must agree that an unambiguous success on keeping inflation below 2% does help growth.
Thus, no experiments.
The ECB will then raise interest rates to slow European growth.
If the EU or the ECB forecast near 3% growth for two consecutive years, watch for interest rates to jump.
The ECB has arrived at where the Bundesbank was for over a decade.
The central bank cannot create growth in an economy that has a bad supply side; in the US, with highly competitive markets, the central bank can afford to stand by.
In Europe, where competition and flexibility are in short supply, indeed are disdained by political leaders, the central bank must be preemptive.
When in doubt, fire.
The ECB is right to establish its inflation-fighting credentials; it is right to be unambiguous in educating labor markets to its total unwillingness to accommodate the old ways.
Only when that point is established, if necessary at the cost of a growth slowdown, can we expect to start seeing improvements in labor market behavior.
Even a slowdown will not be enough so long as governments accommodate unwarranted real wage gains (and the resulting unemployment) with generous income support.
The payoff for Europe cannot come from the central bank, it must come from governments recognizing that the ECB cannot create growth.
Only they can create the conditions for growth by allowing for a far more competitive supply side.
But it is hard to see even the smallest indication of a more competitive supply side.
Governments, most strikingly in Germany, seek to escape from their political dilemmas by talking about the transition to a learning society and other dreams.
At the same time, however, they go out of their way to stop radical cures through aggressive mergers or tough corporate workouts.
None of this will change without a crisis.
But Europe is rich and for that reason won't have a crisis any time soon.
In essence, Europe is satisfied with low growth and borrowing from its grandchildren just because that keeps the peace and it keeps confused and undecided governments in power just a bit longer.
In fact, not just a bit, they can surely play the same game for another decade.
If Europe's economy performs poorly, blame Schroeder, don't blame the ECB.
A new central bank and an old economy mean one thing: low inflation and low growth.
The ECB Picks Up The Pace
Buoyant US economic growth, so far, has provided the European Central Bank with the necessary global backdrop to raise interest rates from very low levels at a slow and steady pace that limits political friction with euro-zone political leaders but that gets the job done.
That is about to change.
The latest anecdotal evidence from the US indicates that the economy is taking a sharp downward turn, which should become manifest in the coming months.
Unless the ECB picks up the pace of interest-rate increases now, the goal of interest-rate neutrality may not be politically feasible, jeopardizing achievement of the bank's price stability goals.
The ECB should act with greater alacrity not because there are increased prospects for future growth, but for the opposite reason: the fear that European growth will slow, thus limiting the possibility for future rate hikes.
Indeed, even before the sudden downturn in the US economy, a growing number of members of the ECB's Governing Council already had come to the conclusion that accelerating the pace of interest-rate increases was needed if its goal of monetary neutrality was to be achieved.
The key reason is that several recent "reforms" announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel - raising the value-added tax, increasing user charges for healthcare, and taxing interest payments as a part of so-called corporate tax reform - promise to reduce German economic growth, perhaps significantly, in 2007.
When Germany sneezes, Europe catches a cold.
As a result, Merkel's reforms have increased the angst of euro-zone central bankers that the "window of opportunity" for future rate hikes might be closing.
The latest ZEW survey of euro-zone business confidence buttresses these fears.
It shows that current conditions are good, but that expectations about future conditions have dropped off significantly.
The message for the ECB is clear: make haste while the sun shines.
That is exactly what the ECB is doing.
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet indicated at his July press conference that the bank plans to raise interest rates by 25 basis points on August 3, not August 31, as expected.
This implies an interval of two months between interest-rate moves instead of the three-month interval that has become standard ECB practice in the current interest-rate cycle.
The next rate hike in the normalization process is expected in October, two months after the expected August move.
Ironically, the October meeting of the ECB's Governing Council will take place in Paris this year.
French politicians have been the most aggressive in putting political pressure on the ECB to relax its interest-rate normalization policy.
French Finance Minister Thierry Breton recently warned the ECB about "nasty surprises."
Prospective French presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy wants the ECB to promote economic growth, not just price stability.
The Paris meeting affords the ECB an opportunity to make a political statement - its "Declaration of Independence," so to speak - by raising interest rates on French soil.
Trichet already has cleared the way for this to happen.
In June, the ECB jettisoned its long-standing practice of not changing rates outside of Frankfurt, increasing them by 25 basis points in Madrid.
Trichet is a clever and resourceful person.
But even he might find it daunting to reconcile the conflicting demands of the ECB to accelerate the interest-rate normalization process and those of the French political establishment to maintain the status quo.
But the recent good economic numbers coming out of France should make an October rate hike easier for French politicians to accept.
The ECB is accelerating the pace of normalization at precisely the right moment.
The danger is that it will be blamed if European growth falters.
However, with the German and US economies slowing precipitously, the ECB would have a perfect cover for its interest-rate moves.
The ECB could convincingly argue that Merkel's reforms and the US, not its interest-rate hikes, are responsible for the European slowdown, should one occur.
Politically, the path is clear for the ECB to act.
The ECB's Battle against Central Banking
BERKELEY - When the European Central Bank announced its program of government-bond purchases, it let financial markets know that it thoroughly disliked the idea, was not fully committed to it, and would reverse the policy as soon as it could.
Indeed, the ECB proclaimed its belief that the stabilization of government-bond prices brought about by such purchases would be only temporary.
It is difficult to think of a more self-defeating way to implement a bond-purchase program.
By making it clear from the outset that it did not trust its own policy, the ECB practically guaranteed its failure.
If it so evidently lacked confidence in the very bonds that it was buying, why should investors feel any differently?
The ECB continues to believe that financial stability is not part of its core business.
As its outgoing president, Jean-Claude Trichet, put it, the ECB has "only one needle on [its] compass, and that is inflation." The ECB's refusal to be a lender of last resort forced the creation of a surrogate institution, the European Financial Stability Facility.
But everyone in the financial markets knows that the EFSF has insufficient firepower to undertake that task - and that it has an unworkable governance structure to boot.
Perhaps the most astonishing thing about the ECB's monochromatic price-stability mission and utter disregard for financial stability - much less for the welfare of the workers and businesses that make up the economy - is its radical departure from the central-banking tradition.
Modern central banking got its start in the collapse of the British canal boom of the early 1820"s.
During the financial crisis and recession of 1825-1826, a central bank - the Bank of England - intervened in the interest of financial stability as the irrational exuberance of the boom turned into the remorseful pessimism of the bust.
In his book Lombard Street, Walter Bagehot quoted Jeremiah Harman, the governor of the Bank of England in the 1825-1826 crisis:
"We lent...by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased exchequer bills, we made advances on exchequer bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank, and we were not on some cases over-nice.
Seeing the dreadful state in which the public were, we rendered every assistance in our power..."
The Bank of England's charter did not give it the legal authority to undertake such lender-of-last-resort financial-stability operations. But the Bank undertook them anyway.
Half a generation later, Britain's Parliament debated whether the modifications of the Bank's charter should give it explicit power to conduct lender-of-last-resort operations.
The answer was no: granting explicit power would undermine confidence in price stability, for already there was "difficulty restrain[ing] over-issue, depreciation, and fraud." Indeed, granting explicit lender-of-last-resort powers to the Bank of England would mean that the "millennium of the paper-mongers would be at hand."
But the leaders of Parliament also believed that the absence of a codified authority to act as lender of last resort would not keep the Bank of England from doing so when necessity commanded.
As First Lord of the Treasury Sir Robert Peel wrote: "If it be necessary to assume a grave responsibility, I dare say men will be willing to assume such a responsibility."
Our current political and economic institutions rest upon the wager that a decentralized market provides a better social-planning, coordination, and capital-allocation mechanism than any other that we have yet been able to devise.
But, since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, part of that system has been a central financial authority that preserves trust that contracts will be fulfilled and promises kept.
Time and again, the lender-of-last-resort role has been an indispensable part of that function.
That is what the ECB is now throwing away.
Saving Europe's Real Hegemon
MUNICH - Last June, the European Commission announced its about-face on bank restructuring.
The money for recapitalizing distressed banks would now come primarily from creditors, not European taxpayers, with a pecking order to specify which lenders would be repaid first.
All of this is welcome, at least in principle.
In practice, however, the scheme leaves much to be desired.
The problem is that a very long list of exceptions reduces the recoverable assets to such an extent that in many cases it will still be impossible to make do without public money. The long-term plan is that this money should come from a fund created by European banks themselves.
But the Eurogroup (a meeting of eurozone finance ministers attended by the European Union's economic and monetary affairs commissioner and the European Central Bank president) is suggesting that, until then, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - and thus the taxpayers - will fill the gap.
Given that taxpayers are thus supposed to finance guarantees for deposits up to €100,000 ($133,000) - the median level of Dutch household wealth and twice the German median - the Eurogroup's proposal boils down to a massive redistribution of wealth in Europe, the dimensions of which are not understood by the public.
The idea of exempting banks" secured debt from the pecking order for repayment is extremely problematic as well.
While this proposal may sound harmless and almost self-evident, it is not; secured debt needs no further protection, because it is already secured.
Viewed from this perspective, the additional protection afforded by the exemption is highly surprising.
The exemption for secured debt undoubtedly concerns mainly the refinancing loans that the ECB has extended to commercial banks against increasingly weak collateral.
For the eurozone's crisis-ridden economies (Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain), the combined total is €732 billion.
These loans extend far beyond providing the liquidity that these countries need for internal circulation, for which a maximum of €335 billion - their available stock of central-bank money - would have sufficed.
Instead, by weakening safety standards, bailing out foreign investors, and financing current-account deficits, the ECB has undercut and replaced the private European interbank market.
With several banks in the crisis countries on the verge of bankruptcy, many of these loans have now turned toxic.
After all, if one takes the average of estimates reported by reputable sources, the write-off losses of the six crisis countries" banks amount to about €670 billion. Participating in these write-offs would put huge strain on the Eurosystem (the ECB and the central banks of the eurozone member states), which has only around €500 billion in equity capital.
The riskiness of the ECB's strategy of using the printing press to bail out banks, including their public and private clients, would become apparent to everyone.
Thus, it is clear how the losses incurred by the ECB's de facto regional fiscal policy are to be avoided: the write-off costs will be transferred from the ECB to the ESM.
This makes no difference to taxpayers, who will have to pay for both institutions" losses in the same manner.
But it has the advantage of allowing the ECB to present itself as having a clean balance sheet, thereby enabling it to maintain its current policy.
Ultimately, this is merely a new round of the eurozone's old game of financial hide-and-seek, whereby losses are obscured by distributing them among different institutions and time horizons. The game started with the bailout fund for Greece, which was followed by the European Financial Stability Facility, the European Financial Stability Mechanism, and the International Monetary Fund, which in turn were relieved by the ESM.
In each case, a major objective was to reduce the burden on the ECB, which had advanced the money by printing it and would have run into serious difficulties without help.
The entire arrangement is highly problematic from the standpoint of democracy, because the initial decisions about undercutting the capital markets by means of public credit were taken by the ECB's Governing Council, in which large countries like France or Germany have the same voting power as Cyprus or Malta.
Indeed, the national central banks" allocation of emergency liquidity assistance required approval by only one-third of the Governing Council's members, and the six crisis countries had these votes.
According to the Eurogroup's proposal, these self-awarded loans, too, are now to be secured by ESM funds.
While the European Union's national parliaments must still decide on the scheme, they essentially have no option but to assent, because to do otherwise would severely harm the ECB.
When they finally get to vote on the matter - years after the ECB's risky credit maneuvers - they will have no choice but to bail out the ECB, the true hegemon of the eurozone.
The ECB's Honeymoon is Over
The honeymoon for the European Central Bank is over.
Because European interest rates no longer are clearly out of whack with the fundamentals of the euro-zone economy, monetary policy has become more complex.
At the same time, France has given a strong mandate to its new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who is without question the most formidable political adversary the ECB has had to face in its brief history.
Sarkozy stands ready to pounce on any mistakes the Bank may make in this more difficult policy environment.
With European interest rates up 200 basis points since late 2005 and the euro near a record high, Sarkozy wants the ECB to stop raising rates now.
ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet and the Governing Council strongly disagree.
At the ECB press conference in early July, Trichet signaled at least one more rate hike - either in September or October.
Some Council members are known to support two more rate hikes before year-end.
What makes monetary policy tricky at this point is that the German economy - which has been Europe's locomotive during the current cyclical upturn - may be reaching a turning point.
Surveys of business and investor confidence have softened - the respected IFO index of German business sentiment fell from 107.0 to 106.4 in Julyamp#45;amp#45;and the so-called "hard data" - industrial production, retail sales, etc.amp#45;amp#45;- has been mixed.
Second quarter German GDP has stalled after a surprisingly strong first quarter.
The jury is out but there is reason to be concerned.
The euro is at record levels, oil prices are surging and interest rates are expected to go higher.
The euro-zone economy - including Germany'samp#45;amp#45;is not bulletproof though the hawks in the Governing Council often talk as if it were.
Just as last year when there was unwarranted growth pessimism in Europe, this year there is unwarranted growth euphoria.
Many Germans, in particular, are in denial that the cyclical upturn may be coming to an end.
Were the Governing Council to miss the coming turn in the European economy while blithely raising interest rates, they would be portrayed as drunken sailors on a rate-raising binge.
The roar for greater political control over Europe's central bank would be deafening - and not only from France.
The political costs for the ECB of making this type of mistake could be exorbitant.
This is why the ECB must be very prudent as it considers whether to maintain the current pace of rate hikes, in which case it would raise rates by 25 basis points in September, or slow the pace down a bit, in which case the next rate hike would come in October at the earliest.
In the current political environment, the dangers to the ECB from outside political interference are much greater from raising rates too fast than too slowly.
If it goes too slow, the ECB has earned sufficient credibility as an inflation fighter to make up for it in the future with little if any economic or political cost.
But if it goes too fast, the political cost could be substantial and irreversible.
Politicians will push for more control and probably get it, Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty.
Waiting until October for the next move up is like buying insurance against a catastrophic loss.
But will the ECB see it this way?
As a matter of principle, the hawks refuse to consider the political costs of their actions.
In earlier times with no formidable adversaries in the political arena, this was a harmless affectation.
But it is an extremely dangerous attitude with people like Sarkozy ready, willing and able to impose high political costs upon the bank should it stumble.
There is more interest in Sarkozy's populist ideas about currency intervention and adding a new political dimension to monetary policy decisions than is commonly realized.
The hawks also suffer from what can be called a "catch up" complex.
No matter how high rates go, they think they're behind.
They want to go in September so that they can go again in December (even before knowing the data) - and they won't stop there either.
Even the doves might support a rate hike in September to counter-act the charge that they are being bullied out of a September hike by Sarkozy.
There is no doubt that Sarkozy's attacks on the ECB are having a counter-productive effect in this regard.
They are pressuring the ECB to raise rates sooner than later.
But a September rate move also serves Sarkozy's interests, as it will give him more ammunition to portray the ECB as out of control and in need of political disciplining.
For the ECB to protect itself from such charges, far better to wait until October when the bank can go to the public and say in effect; "Look, do you see how reasonable we have been.
Now we must raise rates."
In the final analysis, whether the next rate increase comes in September, October or whenever - and it looks like September notwithstanding current warning signs like IFO that suggest a possible slowdown in the coming monthsamp#45;amp#45; the data will determine how far the ECB goes with its rate hikes if the bank is savvy enough to keep the politicians at bay.
But this is a big "if."
The fight is on between the two French titans - Trichet and Sarkozy - with the fate of Europe's central bank hanging in the balance.
The ECB's Path Not Taken
It is now clear that the European Central Bank views higher interest rates as the right response to rising oil prices.
As a result, the ECB risks painting itself into a corner, for the logic behind this week's interest-rate hike implies that more increases will follow - a series of policy mistakes that will cost the Eurozone economies heavily.
Despite statements to the contrary, no central bank, including the ECB, can simply focus on inflation and ignore what happens to economic activity.
Suppose, for the sake of argument, that stabilizing prices came at the cost of a 30% unemployment rate.
Surely nobody would want that.
The ECB's defenders would say that such an outcome is purely hypothetical - and irrelevant - for there is no conflict between stabilizing inflation and sustaining the appropriate level of economic activity.
Price stability, according to this view, reduces uncertainty, thereby enabling firms and individuals to take the right decisions, so it is good, not bad, for economic activity.
This argument is true - most of the time.
But when an economy faces a major adverse shock, such as a sharp increase in oil prices, then the twin goals of stabilizing inflation and maintaining economic activity conflict, and the central bank's job becomes more difficult.
Think about what stabilizing inflation means in such a context.
Firms are likely to pass the increase in energy costs on to consumers by raising their prices.
In response, workers are likely to demand higher nominal wages.
If the central bank is to avoid an inflation spiral, it must ensure that the "first round" effects of higher energy prices on inflation do not fuel such "second round" effects.
In an environment where productivity gains and wage growth are already weak, as in Europe today, persuading workers to accept a cut in real wages may be tough.
The interest-rate increase decided this week will soon appear insufficient, and will have to be followed by further hikes and a large increase in unemployment.
In order to achieve its inflation goal, the ECB may have to contract activity until workers are, in effect, beaten into submission.
Is there a better way to respond to adverse shocks?
The answer from monetary theory is an unambiguous "yes": give workers a chance to adjust to higher energy prices, allow for some pass-through of higher prices to wages over time (so that wages adjust more gradually), and make clear that inflation will return to its target range within, say, a year or two.
Such a policy will limit the increase in unemployment, at the cost of only temporarily higher inflation.
So, why is the ECB set on a tougher course?
There are three plausible reasons.
First, there has been little wage pressure so far.
So the ECB may not have to increase interest rates very much in order to contain inflation.
If this scenario plays out, the impact on economic activity and employment will be minimal.
But there are good historical grounds for thinking that it won't.
What we are seeing in Europe today is more likely to be delayed adjustment rather than passive acceptance of real wage cuts by workers and unions.
The ECB should not delude itself into thinking that a small increase in interest rates will be enough.
If and when wage pressure comes, the ECB, to remain true to its word, may be forced to increase interest rates much more than it now expects.
The second argument is that if the ECB stands firm, workers will not demand higher nominal wages, for they will understand that this would only lead to higher interest rates and higher unemployment.
This argument is not irrelevant; monetary policy probably has some effect on wage bargaining.
But one should not expect too much from a tough ECB stance.
Think of the limited success of the ECB's advocacy of greater labor-market flexibility: there has been no dramatic increase in the pace of reforms.
The third argument is that higher inflation today would endanger the ECB's credibility in the future.
This argument, too, is hardly irrelevant: higher inflation today must not be permitted to change inflation expectations in the medium run.
Leaving interest rates on hold in the face of adverse price shocks thus requires a convincing explanation by the ECB of its underlying policy.
Here, the ECB's task is all the more difficult because, having focused so narrowly on inflation stabilization, markets would read adoption of a more flexible stance as a change in position.
Moreover, because the ECB has actually exceeded its inflation target in recent years, its credibility is already in doubt.
True, adopting the appropriate policy would require the ECB to articulate its rationale with great care.
Here it can take lessons from its British and American counterparts: credibility does not require dogmatism, but rather clarity of purpose.
What is at stake is too important to ignore.
On its current policy path, unless oil prices fall, the ECB risks being forced to commit to substantially higher interest rates, and thus to a further increase in Eurozone unemployment.
The ECB's Risky Business
BRUSSELS - A central bank always has a crucial role to play in a financial crisis.
But the European Central Bank's role within the eurozone nowadays is even more "central" than that of the Federal Reserve or the Bank of England.
A key difference between the eurozone and the United States is that lending between two banks located in two different member countries is still perceived as carrying quite different risks than "domestic" lending (between two banks in the same country).
This is not the case in the US, because it has an integrated financial system, and support for banks (deposit insurance or outright bailouts) is administered at the federal level.
As a result, the fact that California might be closer to bankruptcy than some eurozone countries has no influence at all on the credit rating of banks headquartered there, or on their ability to obtain funds on the interbank market.
In Europe, by contrast, the fate of all banks depends upon their home governments.
During the credit boom before 2007, enormous cross-border interbank claims built up, because banks trusted one another.
Then, in 2008, the interbank market suddenly froze as that trust evaporated.
This was a generalized phenomenon, not focused on particular countries, because it was still assumed at the time that all eurozone governments would be able to bail out their own banks.
Now that the "southern" eurozone governments" solvency no longer seems assured, distrust has grown along national lines.
German banks continue to lend to each other (and to other banks in northern Europe), but they are no longer willing to lend to Italian, Spanish, or other banks in southern Europe.
A sudden withdrawal of interbank funding has the same consequences as a bank run.
A bank that suddenly has to repay its interbank debt must cut credit to its own customers or sell off other assets, leading to large losses.
This is precisely what happened when the interbank market froze after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008.
When the cross-border interbank market stopped working this summer, a similar economic collapse was avoided only because the ECB, without much fanfare, became the eurozone's central clearing house.
German and other northern European banks that no longer trust their southern counterparts parked their funds at the ECB's deposit facility, whereas southern European banks used the ECB's lending facilities to make up for the loss of private interbank funding.
Regional imbalances in interbank funding can, of course, also arise in the US Federal Reserve System.
But they are mostly intermediated within nationwide financial institutions.
For example, high-tech firms in California might deposit cash surpluses with local branches of a large bank operating throughout the US, which might then choose to lend to oil companies in Texas.
Adjustment to shocks is also independent of location in the US.
If the price of oil falls, oil companies become less creditworthy and receive less credit - not because they are in Texas, but because they are oil companies.
In the eurozone, however, banking is still predominantly concentrated along national lines.
A savings surplus in Germany is recycled to Spain mainly through interbank lending (German to Spanish banks).
Moreover, although the EU is supposed to have an integrated banking market, the few existing cross-border banking groups are not even allowed to operate as integrated international banks, because national regulators and supervisors are "ring-fencing" the liquidity and assets of foreign banks" local subsidiaries.
For example, an international banking group headquartered in Italy was recently barred by supervisors from using the cash surplus of its subsidiary in northern Europe to fund the group's operations elsewhere.
That would have been impossible in the US, given that the supervisors are federal.
Moreover, the Federal Reserve System's regional organization is based on nine districts, each of which encompasses several states.
Payment imbalances between Federal Reserve districts thus cannot represent imbalances between states.
A further difference between the eurozone and the US is that the Federal Reserve normally lends only against public debt, and accepts only federal debt (T-bills) as collateral.
Banks thus cannot use any holdings of California or Texas state debt to obtain central-bank funds.
The ECB, on the other hand, accepts private assets and, in the absence of federal debt, national debt as collateral.
This puts the ECB in a very different position from the Fed, because the quality of its collateral is determined along national lines.
For example, Greek banks have received more than €100 billion in ECB financing, which is secured by a mix of private Greek assets and Greek government debt.
If the Greek people decide in a referendum to default, the ECB will incur large losses, as much of its collateral would become worthless and the Greek banking system would collapse.
The imperfect integration of Europe's financial markets and supervisory structure thus risks overburdening the ECB, which has had to become the central counterparty for cross-border lending.
But in this function it has accumulated large risks, concentrated along national lines, thus leading to conflicts among member states.
A common money and a common monetary policy cannot work properly with a banking system that is segmented along national lines.
The most urgent step to stabilize the euro is not to follow the chimera of "euro economic government," but to create the underpinnings of a truly integrated banking market with a common supervisor, a form of "federal" deposit insurance, and a "euro bank rescue fund" for the large cross-border institutions.
The ECB's Tone-Deaf President
PALO ALTO - Once upon a time, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet communicated effectively with the outside world.
Not anymore.
More than a few eyebrows were raised after the ECB's January Governing Council meeting, when Trichet threatened that the Bank would act "preemptively" if labor unions tried to embed higher energy and food prices into new contracts, risking a wage-price spiral.
This threat took a heavy toll on the ECB's credibility, since an interest-rate hike in the midst of the most serious financial crisis in decades was obviously absurd.
No one believed it, and the ECB not only withdrew its clumsy threat the next month, but it adopted a policy of interest-rate neutrality.
But the announcement of this policy change at the February meeting also did not go smoothly.
Trichet somehow garbled the Council's message in his press conference, making it sound as if the ECB wanted to shift to an easing bias instead of "wait and see" neutrality.
European fixed-income markets rallied strongly as a result, only to reverse course days later when Trichet and his colleagues made it clear that the markets had "misread" him.
So there was unwelcome and unneeded market volatility because Trichet couldn't get the message out straight.
Indications that Trichet's communicative skills were slipping already had become evident last September, when the Governing Council could not follow through with the rate increase the ECB president had promised the previous month.
For some unknown reason, Trichet is keen not to surprise markets over the very short term.
He tips them off about what he plans to do one month in advance, using code words like "vigilance" to signal policy change, all the while maintaining with a straight face that the bank never "pre-commits" its policy stance.
Many on the Governing Council object to this childish game of code words, because it eliminates their freedom of action once the Council commits itself to a course of action.
The Council may then be forced to choose between doing the right thing and preserving the credibility of the ECB's communications.
This is precisely what happened in September, when the financial crisis made it impossible for the ECB to proceed with the interest-rate hike that it had "announced" in August.
Code word communications, which only work in a stable and crisis-free economic and financial environment, had damaged ECB credibility.
Calm economic waters had given the ECB and Trichet a honeymoon until last fall.
But, with financial markets now in turmoil and likely to stay that way, the time has come for the ECB to jettison its use of code words - a poor substitute for real central bank transparency in any case.
What also needs to be jettisoned from the ECB's communications policy is its obsession with the short run.
With the United States now in recession (and the possibility of a deep recession not that remote), it is striking how positive ECB officials sound about the European economy: Europe's "economic fundamentals are sound," the economy is "robust," economic performance is "just below potential," and so on.
The ECB's policymakers are not blind, merely shortsighted.
They fear that honesty about Europe's economic prospects over the next year or so might cause markets to force it into an unwanted rate cut now.
So they exaggerate and tell stories about how the European economy is fundamentally different from the US economy.
This is a major mistake, for which the ECB could pay dearly.
Yes, today the European economy is not doing badly.
But how long is this likely to last with the US falling into a deep slump?
The ECB should be preparing Europeans for what many of its own officials admit in private: Europe has not "de-coupled" from the US.
On the contrary, America's current economic difficulties will hit Europe hard, but with a time lag - the best guess being 2009.
This is not to argue, of course, that the ECB should cut interest rates now.
On the contrary, the Bank's current policy of fighting inflationary pressures by slower growth, a stronger euro, and the credit crunch seems just about right for the time being.
But, after all the happy talk about the European economy, how much credibility will the ECB have if Europe eventually succumbs to recessionary pressures from abroad?
The ECB's independence is still a contentious political issue in Europe.
It is more prudent that it voice concern for Europe's future economic prospects today than face a deceived and angry public tomorrow.
The ECB's Two Pillars - A Success
In October 1998, just before the start of the European Monetary Union, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a stability oriented monetary policy strategy.
This strategy comprises three elements: First and foremost it contains a clear commitment to the primary goal of the ECB, which is to safeguard price stability. Price stability was defined as an annual increase in the price level of below two percent over the medium term.
The other two elements, which soon became famous under the headline of "two pillars," serve as a means to assess the risks to the goal of price stability .
The monetary analysis pillar comprises all information coming from various monetary and credit aggregates and serves to figure out the risks to price stability over the medium- to long-run .
The economic analysis pillar is based on a wide set of domestic and international economic indicators from the real and financial sectors (wages, import prices, interest and exchange rates etc.).
It provides a basis for the assessment of short- to medium-term price developments. 
This two pillar approach constitutes a framework for cross-checking indications from the shorter-term economic analysis with those from the longer-term monetary analysis in order to obtain a robust view about the risks to price stability.
In the standard model of the neo-keynesian approach, which has become more and more "state-of-the-art," the usefulness of money to monetary policy analysis is challenged; there is no need for monetary cross-checking, monetary analysis has no value-added and is superfluous.
I am not convinced by these arguments.
Customary inflation forecasts and economic analysis alone are not a sufficient basis for monetary policy decisions.
While such decisions must not ignore longer-term developments, the time horizon for inflation forecasts is usually only one to two years, beyond it gets highly uncertain.
Moreover, while monetary policy has always to be conducted under uncertainty, the ECB was confronted with a situation of extreme uncertainty.
There was uncertainty concerning the state of the economy.
The data situation around the start was very unsatisfactory.
Unobservable indicators like the output gap, which plays e.g. a central role in neo-keynesian recommendations for monetary policy, are generally known to be very difficult to estimate in real time.
Estimates for the output gap of the euro area at that time were especially doubtful with data coming from different international institutions varying widely, and being revised substantially at later stages.
Nor was it clear which models provide the most reasonable account of the functioning of the economy, especially in a case where more or less heterogeneous countries were to form a monetary union.
This was compounded by strategic uncertainty related to how markets, investors and consumers would react to the replacement of national currencies with the Euro. 
In this highly uncertain environment, monetary policy decisions which did not rely on a solid framework could have been misguided.
This posed a risk of substantial policy errors, which would have constituted a deadly blow on reputation, the most important capital of any central bank.
Thus the ECB needed to rely on the few robust results theory and experience can provide.
The long-run connection between money and price developments is among the most robust economic relationships. "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon."
This statement by the late Nobel laureate Milton Friedman has never lost its validity.
And who would deny that monetary policy has to do with money? Certainly, monetary analysis is no easy task, though this is true for all relevant economic explanations. 
No question, the neo-keynesian approach is useful for a central bank's policy analysis.
But including monetary analysis in a monetary policy strategy is vital to the central bank's decision making process.
It would be strange to suggest that any central bank could ignore the information from money.
Many studies have also shown that there is hardly any major asset price inflation episode which was not accompanied if not preceded by strong growth of money and/or credit. 
The question is not whether or not to include monetary analysis in the monetary policy strategy, but how to reconcile the results from the monetary and the economic analyses to achieve a comprehensive and consistent assessment of the risks to price stability.
In the strategy of the ECB this is the role of crosschecking. 
It is not surprising that in a world of low inflation central banks as well as academics have lost interest in "money."
One can only hope that the world does not have to go through the same process of pathological learning via high inflation which followed the neglect of money during the fifties and sixties of the last century.
After all, is it not premature - if not plainly arrogant- to claim that all this evidence collected over many centuries and across numerous countries has lost any meaning for the present and the future?
Can models without an explicit, well developed financial sector be expected to explain an economic world in which financial markets play an ever-increasing role?
How could central banks, which depend on these financial markets to serve as the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, possibly rely on such models?
The ECB has never claimed that its strategy is the ultimate solution to the challenges monetary policy is confronted with.
But, it has recognised the need to include monetary analysis - in a very broad sense - into its policy considerations.
And the strategy was flexible enough to integrate the broadening and deepening of both the monetary and economic analysis.
The two pillar strategy responds to the fact that we (still) lack a model which encompasses both dimensions, the economic or real and the monetary, in a consistent and robust manner.
As long as such a "one-pillar-approach" is unavailable, there is no convincing reason why the ECB should change a strategy which has served it well and allowed it to establish a remarkable track record. 
The GM Reactionaries
PALO ALTO - People everywhere are increasingly vulnerable to the use of what Nobel Prize-winning chemist Irving Langmuir dubbed "pathological science" - the "science of things that aren't so" - to justify government regulation or other policies.
It is a specialty of self-styled public-interest groups, whose agenda is often not to protect public health or the environment, but rather to oppose the research, products, or technology that they happen to dislike.
For example, modern techniques of genetic engineering - also known as biotechnology, recombinant DNA technology, or genetic modification (GM) - provide the tools to make old plants do spectacular new things.
Yet these tools are relentlessly misrepresented to the public.
More than 17 million farmers in roughly three dozen countries worldwide are using GM crop varieties to produce higher yields with fewer inputs and lower environmental impact. Most of these new varieties are designed to resist crop-ravaging pests and diseases, so that farmers can adopt environmentally friendlier no-till practices and use more benign herbicides.
Critics of GM products insist that they are untested, unsafe, unregulated, unnecessary, and unwanted.
But the facts show otherwise.
For starters, there is a broad and longstanding consensus among scientists that recombinant DNA techniques are essentially an extension, or refinement, of earlier methods for genetic modification, and that gene transfer using these precise, predictable molecular techniques does not present any risk per se.
After the cultivation of more than a billion hectares of GM crops worldwide - and the consumption in North America alone of more than two trillion servings of foods that contain GM ingredients - not a single case of injury to a person or disruption of an ecosystem has been documented.
Meanwhile, the benefits of GM-crop cultivation include higher yields, lower use of chemical pesticides, and biofuel production.
Far from being under-regulated, GM plants (and other organisms) have been subjected to expensive, discriminatory, and unscientific over-regulation that has limited the commercial success of maize, cotton, canola, soybeans, and papaya, among other crops.
In fact, opponents often assert that commercial cultivation of GM crops has been a disappointment, because it has offered little direct benefit to consumers.
But many advantages have already been realized.
And GM crops currently in development will deliver even more direct and easily identifiable consumer benefits.
Consider, for example, that, because GM crops require less chemical pesticide, fewer farmers and their families risk being poisoned by runoff into waterways and ground water.
From 1996 to -2009, the amount of pesticide that was sprayed on crops worldwide fell by 393 million kilograms - 1.4 times the total amount of pesticide applied annually to crops in the European Union.
Furthermore, lower levels of mycotoxins in pest-resistant corn mean fewer birth defects, such as spina bifida, and less toxicity to livestock.
Such staple food crops also can be modified to contain additional nutrients.
No-till farming techniques, in which the soil is not plowed, mean less soil erosion, less runoff of agricultural chemicals, and lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions by mechanized farm equipment.
From 1996 to 2009, the shift to biotech crops reduced carbon emissions by 17.6 billion kilograms, the equivalent of removing 7.8 million cars from the road for a year.
GM crops also have significant economic benefits.
Higher yields and lower production costs have reduced global commodity prices (corn, soybeans, and derivatives), resulting in higher farm income, enhanced supplies of food and feed products, and more readily available high-quality calories.
Indeed, farm income grew by nearly $65 million from 1996 to 2009, as biotech crops increased global corn and soybean production by 130 million and 83 million tons, respectively, owing to higher yields and, in Argentina, second cropping of soybeans.
As a result, by 2007, global corn and soybean prices were nearly 6% and 10% lower, respectively, than they would have been had farmers not embraced these crops.
Given their benefits, GM crops" "repeat index" - the proportion of farmers who, after trying a GM variety, choose to plant it again - is very high.
The boost to farm incomes and farm security - which translates into higher household incomes and improved standards of living - is particularly important in developing countries, where income levels are lowest but per-hectare benefits from planting GM varieties have been greatest.
But GM crops do not benefit only those who grow and consume them.
According to a 2010 study, fields of insect-resistant GM corn have an "area-wide suppression effect" on insects, benefiting neighboring fields containing conventional corn varieties.
The researchers calculated that, from 1996 to 2010, cultivating GM varieties increased farmers" profits in three US states by roughly $3.2 billion - $2.4 billion of which accrued to farmers whose nearby fields had not been planted with GM varieties.
The farmers planting the conventional varieties benefit disproportionately, because they do not have to buy the more expensive GM seeds.
Future generations of GM crops will bring even more benefits - but only if they are allowed to flourish.
To that end, consumers must understand that GM crops hold great potential, while posing negligible risks, and governments must adopt regulatory policies that face facts and reject pathological science.
The Economic Consequences of America's Elections
STANFORD - November's mid-term elections were a sharp rebuke to the vast expansion of government spending, deficits, and debt in the United States.
Elected in the midst of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, President Barack Obama and the Democratic leadership of Congress seemed surprised when the public rejected their stimulus, health-care reform, and energy policies by large margins.
Of course, some of the huge increase in expenditure and debt has been the result of the recession, and of the defense and other spending legacies of President George W. Bush.
But, instead of finding security and salvation from recession in a new era of dependence on government, most voters were repelled by such policies" apparent failure to do much to improve the economy. 
Thus, the election results should not be viewed primarily as an endorsement of the Republicans, but as a rebuke to the Democrats" agenda, which voters believed was out of touch with their concerns, interests, and values.
The Republicans took control of the House of Representatives, netting more than 60 seats - the most in over 70 years - and six Senate seats.
They gained in every part of the country, but especially in the industrial heartland from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin.
They also won many governorships and took over many state legislatures; both will play a vital role in redrawing Congressional and legislative districts in the reapportionment next year following the 2010 census.
With divided government, many expect partisan gridlock on major legislation. But there is reason to be hopeful: the American economy, labor market, and stock market have historically fared a bit better in years of divided government.
Moreover, the changed Congressional landscape will be better for trade-related legislation.
The Republicans" protectionist wing is smaller than the Democrats," which may eventually help free-trade agreements between the US and countries such as South Korea and Colombia, as well as a revival of the moribund Doha round of global trade-liberalization talks.
Likewise, economic (but not other) tensions between China and the US should be a little easier to manage.
"Global rebalancing" requires surplus countries such as China to boost consumption, while deficit countries such as the US save more (which requires sharply lower budget deficits and increased private saving).  It will get a more sympathetic hearing from the new Congress than from President Obama, who was soundly rebuked at the Second G-20 Summit for demanding more deficit-financed spending.
The new Congress will not support Obama's additional stimulus plans, such as a national infrastructure bank.
Republicans will want to reform federal infrastructure spending - which is already substantial - rather than add to it.
They are committed to rolling back spending to 2008 levels.
In short, they want to ensure that the spending explosion is indeed temporary, not entrenched in a new baseline for the federal budget.
But Obama's veto power is a big obstacle to reversing his policies.
While Republicans will be able to make some inroads on reducing spending and preventing tax hikes, making good on their vow to "repeal and replace" Obama's signature health-care reform would require a Republican to be elected as president in 2012.
A showdown also looms over tax policy.
Obama's temporary first-year expensing proposal for capital purchases (a good idea as part of a permanent corporate-tax overhaul) could get folded into broader tax legislation.
But the center of attention will be the expiring Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, which reduced marginal tax rates on income, dividends, and capital gains.
Obama wants to let the cuts expire at the end of this year, but only for those with incomes over $250,000.
Republicans will mount substantial pressure to extend the tax cuts for all, as well as to prevent expansion of the so-called alternative minimum tax (which applies if it is larger than the regular tax) from hitting millions more taxpayers. Indeed, the lower marginal rate ought to be made permanent, but accompanied by spending control, with broader tax reform to come later.
Another important feature of the new Congress will be heightened polarization.
The center of gravity of the remaining Democrats has moved to the left, because the vast majority of defeated Democrats were moderates from swing districts.
Likewise, the Republicans elected several conservative senators and a sizeable number of more conservative House members.
This will make compromise even more difficult, as will partisan positioning in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.
Meanwhile, most political analysts do not expect Obama to make as large a move to the political center as President Bill Clinton did when the Republicans took control of Congress after the 1994 mid-term elections.
Clinton then worked with Republicans to balance the budget and reform welfare, easily winning re-election in 1996.
But Obama starts much further left than Clinton, making a move to the middle a longer trek if he decides to embark on it. 
That means that a period of legislative stalemate looms over many of the big issues.
We are likely to see some spending consolidation, but less than in Great Britain and other European countries.
Temporary extension of most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts is also likely.
And trade liberalization may be an area where Obama and Congress can agree.
Inaction in other areas will be bad news for many.
But America's lurch toward a European-style social-welfare state in Obama's first two years appears to have been halted, if not permanently ended or reversed.
And that is good news for the US - and for the global economy.
The Economic Consequences of Silvio Berlusconi
MILAN - Silvio Berlusconi has survived a confidence vote, but his government is virtually dead.
One cannot rule a country with so scant a majority.
Not for long. &#160;
The one important decision that this, Berlusconi's fourth government, ever bothered to take was a decision not to decide.
Two years ago, when financial crisis shook the world, Berlusconi's choice was to avoid any policy intervention to counteract the Great Recession.
This contributed to the deepest fall in output in Italy's postwar history, with a cumulative 6.5% decline in GDP.
Within the G-20, only Japan did worse.
Remarkably, Italy had twice the fall in output seen in France, another large OECD country that, like Italy, had avoided the root causes of the crisis: a housing boom-bust sequence and a serious bank crisis.
The paradox is that the Berlusconi government's inaction did prevent a major deterioration in the public deficit.
In light of the current debt crisis roiling the eurozone, the advantages of a policy of inertia are easy to appreciate.
Italy's position today could have been much worse than it is.
The Italian economy's problems, and the major issues concerning the sustainability of the country's huge public debt, are rooted in low growth of potential output.
As is also revealed by the term structure of credit-default swaps for Italian debt, investors are not worried about, say, the 2011 budget law.
Instead, they are worried about Italy's economic conditions in 5-10 years.
It is these medium-run problems that Berlusconi's government has overlooked.
None of the structural reforms essential to improving Italy's growth potential - for example, labor-market and unemployment benefit reforms, product market liberalizations, improvements of the education system, reforms of the public administration in the South &#160;- &#160;has been carried out, even though Berlusconi could count on solid majorities in both chambers of Parliament.
Why did Berlusconi's government choose such a passive economic policy?
One reason is that the level of Italian debt did not leave much room for countercyclical fiscal policy.
But some effort to stimulate the economy at the outset of the crisis could have been attempted.
For instance, it would have been possible to provide income support to job losers - which would have been useful after the crisis as well - by reforming the system of unemployment benefits.
A possible explanation for the government's inaction over the past two and half years is that the measures agreed upon within the coalition that won the 2008 elections were not tailored to a country entering a major recession.
There was no leadership over economic policy defining new priorities and measures to meet the changed macroeconomic conditions.
In its first month after coming to power, the government did actually try to do something for the economy.
It took three decisions, all of which were soon revealed to be utterly wrong.
The first decision was to reduce taxes on overtime work, a measure clearly aimed at increasing the number of hours worked.
Needless to say, as unemployment rose and many other countries decreased hours worked in order to contain job losses, tax reductions on overtime were phased out and the scope of short-time work was enhanced.
A similar fate occurred to a Robin Hood tax, which, according to Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti, should have forced banks and oil producers to provide resources for the poor.
The tax on banks had to be transformed into a commitment to provide fresh money to troubled financial institutions via the so-called "Tremonti Bonds."
And the increase in the tax on oil producers, implemented when the oil price stood at $160 per barrel, had to be postponed when the price per barrel fell to $30.
The last measure taken was the dismantling of the real-estate tax, a major source of revenue for local governments.
This tax has not yet been restored, but the government is planning to introduce a number of new levies on housing, which would ultimately restore the lost revenues.
In this way, Italy lost 30 months without enacting the structural reforms that it so badly needs to restore the country's growth potential.
True, such reforms are particularly difficult during bad times, but a large number of them have been carried in the European Union precisely during recessions.
The fact of the matter is that downturns are times of "extraordinary politics," in which it is possible to create larger coalitions for far-ranging economic-policy changes.
A government pursuing a reform agenda should, under these circumstances, make the public aware of the emergency conditions and appeal to the responsibility of the opposition.
But the Berlusconi government, and the media directly or indirectly controlled by the prime minister, chose a different communication strategy.
They constantly underplayed the extent of the crisis, and tried to sell the idea that Italy had largely been insulated from the global recession.
This strategy may have prevented the dramatic fall in popularity experienced by other governments in the middle of the Great Recession, but sooner or later will backfire. The disappointment of the majority of Italians with Berlusconi's rule will be even larger when they realize that this government never presented the facts as they are.
The Economic Consequences of the Arab Revolt
NEW YORK - Political turmoil in the Middle East has powerful economic and financial implications, particularly as it increases the risk of stagflation, a lethal combination of slowing growth and sharply rising inflation.
Indeed, should stagflation emerge, there is a serious risk of a double-dip recession for a global economy that has barely emerged from its worst crisis in decades.
Severe unrest in the Middle East has historically been a source of oil-price spikes, which in turn have triggered three of the last five global recessions.
The Yom Kippur War in 1973 caused a sharp increase in oil prices, leading to the global stagflation of 1974-1975.
The Iranian revolution in 1979 led to a similar stagflationary increase in oil prices, which culminated in the recession of 1980-1981.
And Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 led to a spike in oil prices at a time when a US banking crisis was already tipping America into recession.
Oil prices also played a role in the recent finance-driven global recession.
By the summer of 2008, just before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, oil prices had doubled over the previous 12 months, reaching a peak of $148 a barrel - and delivering the coup de grâce to an already frail and struggling global economy buffeted by financial shocks.
We don't know yet whether political contagion in the Middle East will spread to other countries.
The turmoil may yet be contained and recede, sending oil prices back to lower levels.
But there is a serious chance that the uprisings will spread, destabilizing Bahrain, Algeria, Oman, Jordan, Yemen, and eventually even Saudi Arabia.
Even before the recent Middle East political shocks, oil prices had risen above $80-$90 a barrel, an increase driven not only by energy-thirsty emerging-market economies, but also by non-fundamental factors: a wall of liquidity chasing assets and commodities in emerging markets, owing to near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing in advanced economies; momentum and herding behavior; and limited and inelastic oil supplies.
If the threat of supply disruptions spreads beyond Libya, even the mere risk of lower output may sharply increase the "fear premium" via precautionary stockpiling of oil by investors and final users.
The latest increases in oil prices - and the related increases in other commodity prices, especially food - imply several unfortunate consequences (even leaving aside the risk of severe civil unrest).
First, inflationary pressure will grow in already-overheating emerging market economies, where oil and food prices represent up to two-thirds of the consumption basket.
Given weak demand in slow-growing advanced economies, rising commodity prices may lead only to a small first-round effect on headline inflation there, with little second-round impact on core inflation.
But advanced countries will not emerge unscathed.
Indeed, the second risk posed by higher oil prices - a terms-of-trade and disposable income shock to all energy and commodity importers - will hit advanced economies especially hard, as they have barely emerged from recession and are still experiencing an anemic recovery.
The third risk is that rising oil prices reduce investor confidence and increase risk aversion, leading to stock-market corrections that have negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending.
Business and consumer confidence are also likely to take a hit, further undermining demand.
If oil prices rise much further - towards the peaks of 2008 - the advanced economies will slow sharply; many might even slip back into recession.
And, even if prices remain at current levels for most of the year, global growth will slow and inflation will rise.
What policy responses are available to dampen the risk of stagflation?
In the short run, there are very few: Saudi Arabia - the only OPEC producer with excess capacity - could increase its output, and the US could use its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase the supply of oil.
Over time - but this could take years - consumers could invest in alternative energy sources and reduce demand for fossil fuels via carbon taxes and new technologies.
Because energy and food security are matters of economic as well as social and political stability, policies that reduce commodity-price volatility should be in the interest of producers and consumers.
But the time to act is now.
The transition from autocracy to democracy in the Middle East is likely to be bumpy and unstable, at best.
In countries with pent-up demand for higher income and welfare, democratic fervor could lead to large budget deficits, excessive wage demands, and high inflation, ultimately resulting in severe economic crises.
So a bold new assistance program should be designed for the region, modeled on the Marshall Plan in Western Europe after WWII, or on the support offered to Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
Financing should come from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as from bilateral support provided by the US, the European Union, China, and the Gulf states.
The goal should be to stabilize these countries" economies as they undertake their delicate political transitions.
The stakes are high.
Unstable political transitions could lead to high levels of social disorder, organized violence, and/or civil war, fueling further economic and political turmoil.
Given the current risk-sensitivity of oil prices, the pain would not be confined to the Middle East.
The Economic Consequences of War with Iraq
War with Iraq seems inevitable, with or without the support of the UN.
The economic costs of such a war could be huge, both in direct American outlays for war and its aftermath, and in the indirect spillovers on the world economy.
This war would take place against a background of weak economic conditions globally, and would exacerbate those weaknesses, perhaps throwing the world economy into recession.
The economic outcome of war could well depend on the diplomatic context.
If America acts alone, the likely costs of war to the world economy will be higher than if it has the backing of the UN.
The costs of war must be balanced against the costs of alternative actions.
A high cost of war is certainly not a case for inaction, especially in the face of a serious risk that Iraq could obtain, and eventually use, weapons of mass destruction.
Yet pursuing war where diplomatic means - weapons inspections, threats of retaliation in the face of Iraqi aggression, readiness of the UN to act if dangers from Iraq become imminent - might suffice could result in huge and avoidable economic (as well as other) costs.
The traditional textbook view of war is that war stimulates an economy, at least in the short term.
But that simple view of wartime economics is too narrow to describe the possible effects of an Iraqi war.
We must also recognize that a war with Iraq, even a limited war, could profoundly disrupt the international flow of goods, services, and investments upon which our global economy now rests.
These disruptive effects would not only dampen production, but would undermine investor and consumer confidence and thereby limit both private investment and consumer spending.
The direct macroeconomic stimulus that could arise from military spending may be overwhelmed by the uncertainties and disruptions that would accompany military conflict.
Such uncertainties are already visible.
Oil prices have risen several dollars a barrel since late summer.
Since June, US and world stock markets have declined by around 20% in dollar terms.
Each rise in the probability of war has tended to push the markets down further.
The modern world economy is built upon a complex network of global economic connections, and those connections are directly threatened by war.
War would pose obvious and direct risks to shipping, notably shipping of oil from the Middle East.
The increased costs could further depress the drop of cross-border capital flows that has been underway for two years, since the end of the US stock market boom.
The decline in cross-border flows intensified after the September 11 attacks last year.
Foreign direct investment in many developing regions has dried up, and emerging markets that depend on such capital flows, particularly in South America, have seen their economies thrown into a renewed financial crisis.
Even if the US economy might experience some short-term demand boost from increased military spending, the rest of the world would not.
Most countries would feel only negative effects - disruptions of trade, higher oil prices, withdrawals of international capital, cutbacks on investment plans - without any offsetting direct stimulus.
America's macroeconomic situation is also worrisome.
The Bush Administration's fiscal policies, combined with the bursting of the US financial bubble of the late 1990s, have pushed America onto an unstable fiscal trajectory.
In contrast to budget surpluses "as far as the eye could see," the US now has large budget deficits that will linger for many years to come.
War with Iraq would likely cause those budget deficits to soar.
Rising budget deficits will poison US domestic politics and lead to budgetary gridlock.
That in turn, could lead to a loss of consumer confidence.
Since consumer spending has been the remaining bulwark of the US economy since the collapse of the financial bubble, war with Iraq could puncture the last point of stability in the US economy.
Of course, US policymakers have a hidden "ace in the hole."
They believe that the war will be quick, virtually effortless, and self-financing, as the US. effectively gains control of Iraqi oil supplies, which will not only drive down world oil prices but also finance Iraq's postwar reconstruction.
An alluring prospect, but perhaps improbable.
War might not be quick at all.
Postwar Iraq could be unstable even if the war is brief.
An alternative scenario is huge uncertainty and turmoil throughout the Middle East, with major disruptions in oil flows, for political if not military reasons.
The geopolitical costs of a unilateral US war will be even higher.
A quick and successful war, strongly and explicitly backed by the UN, offers the greatest chance of avoiding a huge negative economic fallout.
A war that pits America against the world could call into doubt the progress of globalization, particularly international trade negotiations.
Moreover, if the US acts alone, no doubt the post-conflict costs that America will bear alone will be higher as well.
Open and deep political divisions between America and other major countries will incite a loss of investor confidence, undermining global economic stability.
The Economic Costs of Fear
BERKELEY - The S&amp;P stock index now yields a 7% real (inflation-adjusted) return.
By contrast, the annual real interest rate on the five-year United States Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) is -1.02%.
Yes, there is a "minus" sign in front of that: if you buy the five-year TIPS, each year over the next five years the US Treasury will pay you in interest the past year's consumer inflation rate minus 1.02%.
Even the annual real interest rate on the 30-year TIPS is only 0.63% - and you run a large risk that its value will decline at some point over the next generation, implying a big loss if you need to sell it before maturity.
So, imagine that you invest $10,000 in the S&amp;P index.
This year, your share of the profits made by those companies will be $700.
Now, imagine that, of that total, the companies pay out $250 in dividends (which you reinvest to buy more stock) and retain $450 in earnings to reinvest in their businesses.
If the companies" managers do their job, that reinvestment will boost the value of your shares to $10,450.
Add to that the $250 of newly-bought shares, and next year the portfolio will be worth $10,700 - more if stock-market valuations rise, and less if they fall.
In fact, over any past period long enough for waves of optimism and pessimism to cancel each other out, the average earnings yield on the S&amp;P index has been a good guide to the return on the portfolio.
So, if you invest $10,000 in the S&amp;P for the next five years, you can reasonably expect (with enormous upside and downside risks) to make about 7% per year, leaving you with a compounded profit in inflation-adjusted dollars of $4,191.
If you invest $10,000 in the five-year TIPS, you can confidently expect a five-year loss of $510.
That is an extraordinary gap in the returns that you can reasonably expect.
It naturally raises the question: why aren't people moving their money from TIPS (and US Treasury bonds and other safe assets) to stocks (and other relatively risky assets)?
People have different reasons. And many people's thinking is not terribly coherent.
But there appear to be two main explanations.
First, many people are uncertain that current conditions will continue.
Most economists forecast the world a year from now to look a lot like the world today, with unemployment and profit margins about the same, wages and prices on average about 1.5% higher, total production up roughly 2%, and risks on both the upside and the downside.
But many investors see a substantial chance of 2008 and 2009 redux, whether triggered by a full-fledged euro crisis or by some black swan that we do not yet see, and fear that, unlike in 2008 and 2009, governments would lack the power and will to cushion the economic impact.
These investors do not view the 7% annual return on stocks as an average expectation, with downside risks counterbalanced by upside opportunities.
Rather, they see a good-scenario outcome that only the foolhardy would trust.
Second, many people do see the 7% return on stocks as a reasonable expectation, and would jump at the chance to grab it - plus the opportunity of surprises on the upside - but they do not think that they can afford to run the downside risks.
Indeed, the world seems a much more risky place than it seemed five or ten years ago.
The burden of existing debts is high, and investors" key goal is loss-avoidance, not profit-seeking.
Both reasons reflect a massive failure of our economic institutions.
The first reason betrays a lack of trust that governments can and will do the job that they learned how to do in the Great Depression: keep the flow of spending stable so that big depressions with long-lasting, double-digit unemployment do not recur.
The second reveals the financial industry's failure adequately to mobilize society's risk-bearing capacity for the service of enterprise.
As individuals, we appear to view a gamble that has a roughly 50% chance of doubling our wealth and a roughly 50% chance of halving it as worthy of consideration - not a no-brainer, but not out of the question, either.
Well-functioning financial markets would mobilize that risk-bearing capacity and put it to use for the benefit of all, so that people who did not think that they could run the risks of stock ownership could lay that risk off onto others for a reasonable fee.
As an economist, I find this state of affairs frustrating.
We know, or at least we ought to know, how to build political institutions that accept the mission of macroeconomic stabilization, and how to build financial institutions to mobilize risk-bearing capacity and spread risk.
Yet, to a remarkable degree, we have failed to do so.
The Economic Future of Egypt's Revolution
CAMBRIDGE - For Egypt, the question of the day is whether the country will build an open, democratic political system or relapse into some form - new or old - of autocracy.
But an equally important question - above all for Egyptians, but also for other developing countries (and for development experts) - is the economic impact of its revolution.
For the past quarter-century, a major agenda item for the international development organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has been to bolster developing nations" financial markets.
Stronger financial markets can move savings to where they can do the most to spur economic growth.
And that capacity has been seen as one of the handful of key prerequisites for economic development.
Making finance work should boost economic development significantly.
Economic historians point to financial revolutions as setting the stage for strong economic development in England (in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, following the Glorious Revolution), in the United States (after Alexander Hamilton in the 1790"s built up major financial structures in a primarily agricultural country), and in Japan (after the Meiji Restoration).
The World Bank, the IMF, and dozens of academics have studied long and hard what makes financial markets grow and what holds them back.
Many focus on the quality of institutions, such as courts and tax authorities.
Others emphasize the quality of corporate law.
Still others look at policies, like trade openness or lightness of taxation.
Everyone extols property rights.
Yet, when one looks at what actually happens in developing countries, the lessons are disappointing.
Though some countries have fixed their court systems, streamlined their tax administrations, and begun to get a handle on corruption, the impact on financial markets has been uneven.
Worse still for some theories of what makes financial markets flourish are the examples of the US, Great Britain, and Japan.
Financial markets leaped forward in eighteenth-century Great Britain, and in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Japan and the US - a time when several key institutions, such as corporate law and the court system, were woefully substandard.
American courts in the nineteenth century were notably corrupt, sometimes incompetent, and often irrelevant, yet stock and bond markets grew, and continent-spanning firms rose up and got the financing they needed to operate, expand, and industrialize the US economy.
The core protective legal institution for outside finance, the federal securities laws, didn't fall into place until the 1930"s - decades after US financial markets had grown to finance America's economic rise.
Britain and Japan seem to have followed the same sequence: finance first, protective institutions later.
Japan had no corporate law until complex business finance started developing at the end of the nineteenth century.
Yet that sequence is the opposite of what one might have expected: only after financial markets developed did those with a stake in them press for better legislation to protect investors.
So, in Britain, Japan, and the US, something more foundational must have been in place before financial markets started operating.
Something else must affect which countries are most likely to get strong finance, which won't, and when it all happens.
That "something" now usually seems to be basic political stability, preferably of the democratic kind.
In a stable political environment, informal mechanisms - such as reputations for reliability, trade associations, and stock exchanges - can develop and facilitate financial dealings.
Investors and businesses don't fear that a new regime can take power and call off all, or too many, bets, leading to losses on their investments.
The data linking democratic political instability and financial backwardness in the modern era, which Jordan Siegel of the Harvard Business School and I analyze in a forthcoming article, show unmistakably that instability powerfully predicts an inability to develop financial markets.
Democratic political stability is the most important harbinger of financial development.
There is a deep logic to this finding.
Even if all of the rules for finance are right, few will part with their money if they fear that an unfavorable regime change might occur during the lifetime of their investment.
More importantly, the grim stability of the type displayed by Hosni Mubarak's Egypt is oftentimes insufficient for genuine financial development.
Authoritarian regimes, especially those with severe income and wealth inequality, inherently create a risk of arbitrariness, unpredictability, and instability.
They are themselves arbitrary.
And everyone knows that beneath the stability of the moment lurk explosive forces that can change the regime and devalue huge investments.
Because financiers and savers have limited confidence in the future, such regimes can't readily build and maintain strong foundations for financial development.
By contrast, democratic regimes with widespread property ownership typically best protect property rights over the long term, because enough people in the polity want to protect property.
Yes, the rules of the game count for finance. But what counts even more is that the polity has a continuing, stable stake in keeping those rules in place and making them work for finance and economic growth.
So, what does this mean for Egypt?
The Egyptian revolution is political thus far, not economic.
Yet, if the revolution leads to a more open, democratic, middle-class-oriented political system, in which enough people believe that they have a stake in the government's continuity, the economic benefits for Egyptians could be large.
Financial markets will more likely flourish, and more rapid and equitable development will more likely follow.
The Economic Governance the EU Needs
BRUSSELS - Two lessons have emerged from Europe's financial crisis. First, there is no substitute for timely and coordinated action when the single currency is under pressure.
Second, all eurozone countries are effectively in the same boat.
If the boat springs a leak, everyone sinks.
A quicker and more concerted response might have limited the fall-out from the crisis, and thus its cost.
The European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF), hurriedly established in May 2010 in an effort to stop the rot, will shortly be able to call on some €500 billion in the event that any more eurozone countries face serious liquidity problems.
And eurozone member states have agreed to perpetuate this financial-stability mechanism from 2013 onwards, and even to amend the Lisbon treaty to avoid any legal ambiguity.
Despite all this, markets remain unconvinced by the eurozone's shows of solidarity.
Greek sovereign debt has been downgraded to below that of Egypt.
Portugal has had to ask for assistance from the EFSF and the International Monetary Fund.
Irish banks reportedly need an additional €24 billion to stay afloat.
And Spain is doing all it can to avoid the contagion.
The irony is that the euro has been a hugely successful project, bringing considerable stability to participating countries.
Indeed, without the single currency, many of these countries would have succumbed to a downward spiral of devaluation, default, and recourse to the IMF.
The European Central Bank has played a crucial role in preventing a worst-case scenario, but the obvious lacuna in Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) remains: EMU established only a monetary union and largely omitted the economic union that has proven so closely linked to the euro's strengths and weaknesses.
The real crisis facing Europe is one of economic governance.
Eurozone member states have increasingly gone their own way, even overtly defending nationalist economic policies that harm the eurozone as a whole.
This is not to say that a single economic policy should be imposed on everyone; but Europe does need a higher degree of coordination and convergence to ensure that everyone is at least heading in the same direction.
Like cars on a highway, some may drive more slowly than others, but there are minimum and maximum speeds and all must go with the flow of traffic.
Moreover, all motorists must respect the rules of the road, and anyone who breaches them must be held to account, and possibly penalized, because even one rogue driver will most likely cause a major pile-up if not stopped.
So it is with economic governance: anarchy would be devastating.
Agreement is needed on both the rules and the impartial body to enforce them.
European Union leaders have in recent summits come close to identifying a number of economic-policy areas where closer coordination would improve competitiveness, including sustainability of pensions, wage-to-productivity ratios, corporate taxation, investment in research and development, and the financing of major infrastructure projects.
Yet the same EU members have failed to endow the European Commission with overall responsibility for holding member governments to their commitments and, where necessary, imposing penalties for breaches.
This intergovernmental approach lay behind the Lisbon Agenda's failure to deliver the results needed to make Europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010, and the same shortcomings will bedevil its successor, the new "Europe 2020" strategy.
Indeed, it is a failure of governance that has characterized the Stability and Growth Pact, designed (largely by Germany) to ensure sound macroeconomic policy by limiting national debt and deficit ratios.
Most eurozone members are now in breach of the Pact, yet none has been subjected to the penalties envisaged by its architects.
Recently adopted changes create a more sensible and graduated system for sanctioning recalcitrant countries, but still leave the decision to initiate an excessive deficit procedure to member states, rather than establishing the more automatic mechanism sought by the European Commission.
Meanwhile, the Commission already polices the internal market - one of Europe's major policy successes - by monitoring member states" compliance with the single market's rules.
It also launches infringement proceedings against member states that have not implemented valid directives on time, or in the correct manner.
Similarly, EU competition policy has stood firm for many years against monopolies and abuse of dominant market positions.
Here, too, the Commission plays the role of neutral judge.
There may be disputes in some cases, but the system has brought a degree of legal certainty across the single market that the EU's member states could not have achieved on their own.
The challenge now for EU leaders is not to repackage old policies, but to express a collective vision and will to act together.
I have been arguing for a Community Act that would bring together all elements of economic governance under a single framework, with the European Commission at its center.
As with the single-market program of the 1980"s, the Commission could be in charge of overseeing a convergence of national economic policies, within certain parameters, throughout the EU.
Straying outside of those parameters would lead to warnings and sanctions, but otherwise there would be some flexibility for member states to pursue the EU's collective goals at a pace adapted to their national circumstances.
A cluster of EU commissioners holding economic-related portfolios could even be made responsible for guiding the process forward, providing it with direction and momentum.
If European countries are to emerge stronger from the current crisis, they need to think bigger and put more faith, not less, in the collective enterprise that is the EU.
After all, European unification was conceived as a project of pooled sovereignty, not surrendered prosperity.
The Economic Imperatives of the Arab Spring
WASHINGTON, DC/ISTANBUL - Almost a year has passed since revolution in Tunisia and protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square toppled ossified authoritarian regimes and ignited a much wider - and still raging - storm in the Arab world.
No one can safely predict where these events will eventually take the Arab people and nations.
But one thing is certain: there is no turning back.
New social and political movements and structures are emerging, power is shifting, and there is hope that democratic processes will strengthen and spread across the Arab world in 2012.
Events in the Arab world in 2011 recall other far-reaching regional transitions, such as in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
There are differences, of course, but the upheavals" sweeping and contagious nature is strongly similar to that of the revolutions that brought communism to an end in Europe.
So, too, is the debate about the relative contributions of political and economic factors to the eventual eruption of popular protest.
While the yearning for dignity, freedom of expression, and real democratic participation was the driving force underlying the Arab revolutions, economic discontent played a vital role, and economic factors will help to determine how the transition in the Arab world unfolds. &nbsp;Here, three fundamental and longer-term challenges are worth bearing in mind.

First, growth will have to be much more inclusive, especially in terms of job creation.
The youth employment-to-population ratio was about 27% in the Arab countries in 2008, compared to 53% in East Asia.
Moreover, income inequality has widened, with the global phenomenon of increasing concentration of wealth at the top very pronounced in many Arab countries.
Top incomes in these countries have resulted largely from political patronage, rather than from innovation and hard work.
While Tunisia was an extreme case of a regime furthering the economic interests of a small clique of insiders, the pattern was widespread.
That is why a knee-jerk, simplistic "Washington Consensus" prescription of more liberalization and privatization is inappropriate for the Arab world in 2012.
There is a clear political need for a growth strategy in which inclusion is the centerpiece, not an afterthought.
Neither the old statist left, nor the rent-seeking, crony-capitalist right had policies to respond to the yearning for inclusion.
New political forces in the Arab world, Islam-inspired or social-democratic, will have to propose policies that do not just perpetuate rent-seeking capitalism or reliance on a discredited state bureaucracy.
It will be necessary to harness grass-roots dynamism and entrepreneurial potential to achieve social solidarity and equity.
While a truly competitive private sector has to be unleashed, the state must not be weakened but transformed, to become one that is at the service of citizens.
Generous but targeted and performance-oriented social transfers, conditional on participation in health and basic education programs, will have to replace the old, largely untargeted subsidies.
Public development finance will have to focus on large-scale access to housing and a people-oriented infrastructure.
All of this has to be achieved within a sustainable budget framework, requiring both funds and comprehensive administrative reforms.
Accompanying inclusive growth, the second challenge is skill development, for which a performance-oriented education system must become a top priority.
Many Arab countries have spent huge sums on education; the problem is that the return on these investments has been dismal.
Arab students, for example, score well below average on international mathematics and science tests.
Deep reforms - focused on quality and performance, rather than on enrollment and diplomas - are needed to transform the learning process and unleash the productivity growth that a young labor force requires.
The third challenge, instrumental to meeting the first two, will be to strengthen regional Arab solidarity.
Many outsiders underestimate or purposefully minimize the "Arabness" of the Arab world.
But the revolutions of 2011 demonstrated that a strong sense of identity, a common language, and much shared history bind Arabs together, despite huge differences in natural-resource endowments, political circumstances, and average per capita incomes.
How else can one explain that an act of revolt in Tunisia led to popular revolts from North Africa to the Arabian Peninsula?
One implication of this is that the oil-rich states and leaders cannot expect to remain isolated and protected from the unfolding events.
The future of the region is also their future; the transition that started in 2011 unleashed forces that cannot be stopped.
But the transition can be more orderly, more peaceful, and less disruptive if states that command immense resources and wealth generously support the poorer countries - and back the reforms that all Arab countries need.
Existing institutions with proven track records, such as the Arab Fund, can help, but this requires scaling up their funds dramatically.
Prosperity and peace in the region will depend on thinking big and acting fast.
The revolutions of 2011 are a historic opportunity for all Arabs.
Making the most of it will require realism, courage, willingness to change, and a readiness to support change, particularly among those who have the greatest means to do so.
The Economics of Happiness
NEW YORK - We live in a time of high anxiety.
Despite the world's unprecedented total wealth, there is vast insecurity, unrest, and dissatisfaction.
In the United States, a large majority of Americans believe that the country is "on the wrong track."
Pessimism has soared.
The same is true in many other places.
Against this backdrop, the time has come to reconsider the basic sources of happiness in our economic life.
The relentless pursuit of higher income is leading to unprecedented inequality and anxiety, rather than to greater happiness and life satisfaction.
Economic progress is important and can greatly improve the quality of life, but only if it is pursued in line with other goals.
In this respect, the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan has been leading the way.
Forty years ago, Bhutan's fourth king, young and newly installed, made a remarkable choice: Bhutan should pursue "gross national happiness" rather than gross national product.
Since then, the country has been experimenting with an alternative, holistic approach to development that emphasizes not only economic growth, but also culture, mental health, compassion, and community.
Dozens of experts recently gathered in Bhutan's capital, Thimphu, to take stock of the country's record.
I was co-host with Bhutan's prime minister, Jigme Thinley, a leader in sustainable development and a great champion of the concept of "GNH."
We assembled in the wake of a declaration in July by the United Nations General Assembly calling on countries to examine how national policies can promote happiness in their societies.
All who gathered in Thimphu agreed on the importance of pursuing happiness rather than pursuing national income.
The question we examined is how to achieve happiness in a world that is characterized by rapid urbanization, mass media, global capitalism, and environmental degradation.
How can our economic life be re-ordered to recreate a sense of community, trust, and environmental sustainability?
Here are some of the initial conclusions.
First, we should not denigrate the value of economic progress.
When people are hungry, deprived of basic needs such as clean water, health care, and education, and without meaningful employment, they suffer.
Economic development that alleviates poverty is a vital step in boosting happiness.
Second, relentless pursuit of GNP to the exclusion of other goals is also no path to happiness.
In the US, GNP has risen sharply in the past 40 years, but happiness has not.
Instead, single-minded pursuit of GNP has led to great inequalities of wealth and power, fueled the growth of a vast underclass, trapped millions of children in poverty, and caused serious environmental degradation.
Third, happiness is achieved through a balanced approach to life by both individuals and societies.
As individuals, we are unhappy if we are denied our basic material needs, but we are also unhappy if the pursuit of higher incomes replaces our focus on family, friends, community, compassion, and maintaining internal balance.
As a society, it is one thing to organize economic policies to keep living standards on the rise, but quite another to subordinate all of society's values to the pursuit of profit.
Yet politics in the US has increasingly allowed corporate profits to dominate all other aspirations: fairness, justice, trust, physical and mental health, and environmental sustainability.
Corporate campaign contributions increasingly undermine the democratic process, with the blessing of the US Supreme Court.
Fourth, global capitalism presents many direct threats to happiness.
It is destroying the natural environment through climate change and other kinds of pollution, while a relentless stream of oil-industry propaganda keeps many people ignorant of this.
It is weakening social trust and mental stability, with the prevalence of clinical depression apparently on the rise.
The mass media have become outlets for corporate "messaging," much of it overtly anti-scientific, and Americans suffer from an increasing range of consumer addictions.
Consider how the fast-food industry uses oils, fats, sugar, and other addictive ingredients to create unhealthy dependency on foods that contribute to obesity.
One-third of all Americans are now obese.
The rest of the world will eventually follow unless countries restrict dangerous corporate practices, including advertising unhealthy and addictive foods to young children.
The problem is not just foods.
Mass advertising is contributing to many other consumer addictions that imply large public-health costs, including excessive TV watching, gambling, drug use, cigarette smoking, and alcoholism.
Fifth, to promote happiness, we must identify the many factors other than GNP that can raise or lower society's well-being.
Most countries invest to measure GNP, but spend little to identify the sources of poor health (like fast foods and excessive TV watching), declining social trust, and environmental degradation.
Once we understand these factors, we can act.
The mad pursuit of corporate profits is threatening us all.
To be sure, we should support economic growth and development, but only in a broader context: one that promotes environmental sustainability and the values of compassion and honesty that are required for social trust.
The search for happiness should not be confined to the beautiful mountain kingdom of Bhutan.
The Unstarvable Beast
CAMBRIDGE - As the world watches the United States grapple with its fiscal future, the contours of the battle reflect larger social and philosophical divisions that are likely to play out in various guises around the world in the coming decades.
There has been much discussion of how to cut government spending, but too little attention has been devoted to how to make government spending more effective.
And yet, without more creative approaches to providing government services, their cost will continue to rise inexorably over time.
Any service-intensive industry faces the same challenges.
Back in the 1960"s, the economists William Baumol and William Bowen wrote about the "cost disease" that plagues these industries.
The example they famously used was that of a Mozart string quartet, which requires the same number of musicians and instruments in modern times as it did in the nineteenth century.
Similarly, it takes about the same amount of time for a teacher to grade a paper as it did 100 years ago.
Good plumbers cost a small fortune, because here, too, the technology has evolved very slowly.
Why does slow productivity growth translate into high costs?
The problem is that service industries ultimately have to compete for workers in the same national labor pool as sectors with fast productivity growth, such as finance, manufacturing, and information technology.
Even though the pools of workers may be somewhat segmented, there is enough overlap that it forces service-intensive industries to pay higher wages, at least in the long run.
The government, of course, is the consummate service-intensive sector.
Government employees include teachers, policemen, trash collectors, and military personnel.
Modern schools look a lot more like those of 50 years ago than do modern manufacturing plants.
And, while military innovation has been spectacular, it is still very labor-intensive.
If people want the same level of government services relative to other things that they consume, government spending will take up a larger and larger share of national output over time.
Indeed, not only has government spending been rising as a share of income; so, too, has spending across many service sectors.
Today, the service sector, including the government, accounts for more than 70% of national income in most advanced economies.
Agriculture, which in the 1800"s accounted for more than half of national income, has shrunk to just a few percent.
Manufacturing employment, which accounted for perhaps a third of jobs or more before World War II, has shrunk dramatically.
In the US, for example, the manufacturing sector employs less than 10% of all workers.
So, even as economic conservatives demand spending cuts, there are strong forces pushing in the other direction.
Admittedly, the problem is worse in the government sector, where productivity growth is much slower even than in other service industries.
Whereas this might reflect the particular mix of services that governments are asked to provide, that can hardly be the whole story.
Surely, part of the problem is that governments use employment not just to provide services, but also to make implicit transfers.
Moreover, government agencies operate in many areas in which they face little competition - and thus little pressure to innovate.
Why not bring greater private-sector involvement, or at least competition, into government?
Education, where the power of modern disruptive technologies has barely been felt, would be a good place to start.
Sophisticated computer programs are becoming quite good at grading middle-school essays, if not quite up to the standards of top teachers.
Infrastructure is another obvious place to expand private-sector involvement.
Once upon a time, for example, it was widely believed that drivers on privately operated roads would constantly be waiting to pay tolls.
Modern transponders and automatic payment systems, however, have made that a non-issue.
But one should not presume that a shift to greater private-sector provision of services is a panacea.
There would still be a need for regulation, especially where monopoly or near-monopoly is involved.
And there would still be a need to decide how to balance efficiency and equity in the provision of services.
Education is clearly an area in which any country has a strong national interest in providing a level playing field.
As US President in the 1980"s, the conservative icon Ronald Reagan described his approach to fiscal policy as "starve the beast": cutting taxes will eventually force people to accept less government spending.
In many ways, his approach was a great success.
But government spending has continued to grow, because voters still want the services that government provides.
Today, it is clear that reining in government also means finding ways to shape incentives so that innovation in government keeps pace with innovation in other service sectors.
Without more ideas about how to innovate in the provision of government services, battles such as one sees playing out in the US today can only become worse, as voters are increasingly asked to pay more for less.
Politicians can and will promise to do a better job, but they cannot succeed unless we identify ways to boost government services" efficiency and productivity.
The Economics of Strategic Containment
NEW DELHI - At their recent summit in Cannes, the G-20 shelved, if not buried, the World Trade Organization's moribund Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
Crisis-weary Europe and America face a rising tide of protectionism at home, and are trying to find ways to blunt the edge of China's non-transparent trade competitiveness.
Turning his attention from the Atlantic to the Pacific, US President Barack Obama - with his eye, once again, trained on China - has now unveiled a new regional trade initiative.
Why was the US unwilling to move forward on the Doha Round, but willing to pursue a regional free-trade agreement?
The answer lies in the fact that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), launched by Obama and the governments of eight other Pacific economies - Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam - is not just about trade.
While Obama chose to stick to the economic factors driving the TPP, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on the eve of the just-concluded Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Hawaii, laid out the initiative's wider strategic context.
"The United States will continue to make the case that....[the region] must pursue not just more growth, but better growth," which "is not merely a matter of economics," Clinton said.
"Openness, freedom, transparency, and fairness have meaning far beyond the business realm," she continued.
"Just as the United States advocates for them in an economic context, we also advocate for them in political and social contexts."
Following up on these remarks, Obama drew attention to persistent US concern about China's exchange-rate policy, inadequate protection of intellectual property, and impediments to market access.
"For an economy like the United States - where our biggest competitive advantage is our knowledge, our innovation, our patents, our copyrights - for us not to get the kind of protection we need in a large marketplace like China is not acceptable," Obama observed.
The TPP initiative should be viewed against this background, and not just in the context of the collapse of the Doha Round.
The TPP's nine sponsors have resolved "to establish a comprehensive, next-generation regional agreement that liberalizes trade and investment and addresses new and traditional trade issues and twenty-first-century challenges."
These leaders also agreed to fast-track the TPP initiative, and to consider opening it to other members - most importantly Japan, a late convert to the idea of a Pacific region free-trade agreement.
The TPP's agenda is divided into three categories: core, cross-cutting, and emerging issues.
The core agenda is to stitch together a traditional free-trade agreement focused on industrial goods, agriculture, and textiles.
The agreement would also have provisions for intellectual-property protection and what are dubbed the social and environmental issues.
In short, the TPP's core agenda will offer the region a "Doha Round-type" agreement that includes the social and environmental agenda that developing economies have been resisting within the WTO.
Going beyond the core, the cross-cutting issues include investor-friendly regulatory systems and policies that enable "innovative" or "employment-creating" small and medium-size enterprises to operate freely across borders within the TPP region.
Finally, the TPP seeks to bring into the ambit of a trade and investment agreement "new and emerging" issues.
These include "trade and investment in innovative products and services, including digital technologies, and ensuring state-owned enterprises compete fairly with private companies and do not distort competition in ways that put US companies and workers at a disadvantage."
In short, the US has moved to bring together all of the economies in the region that are worried about China's beggar-thy-neighbor trade and exchange-rate policies.
For the US, the eight other TPP countries, with a combined population of 200 million, constitute its fourth largest export market, behind only China, the European Union, and Japan.
If Japan joins, the TPP's importance would rise dramatically.
While the economics of the TPP is important, the strategic component is even more so.
This is the second leg of America's new "Pacific offensive," aimed at offering nations in the region an alternative to excessive and rapidly growing dependence on a rising China.
The first leg of the offensive was the idea of the "Indo-Pacific" region, which Clinton developed a year ago and followed up this year with an essay called "America's Pacific Century."
There, she defines the new region of US strategic engagement as "stretching from the Indian subcontinent to the western shores of the Americas."
Extending east from the Indian Ocean and west via the Pacific, the US is creating a new strategic framework for the twenty-first century.
The TPP is just one of the pillars of that new edifice.
The Economy and the Presidency
CAMBRIDGE - America's presidential election is now just six months away.
If history is a reliable guide, the outcome will depend significantly on the economy's performance between now and November 6, and on Americans" perception of their economic future under the two candidates.
At the moment, America's economy is limping along with slow growth and high unemployment.
Output grew by just 1.5% last year, and real GDP per capita is lower now than before the economic downturn began at the end of 2007.
Although annual GDP growth was 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011, more than half of that reflected inventory accumulation.
Final sales to households, businesses, and foreign buyers rose at only a 1.1% annual rate, even slower than earlier in the year.
And the preliminary estimate for annual GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012 was a disappointing 2.2%, with only a 1.6% rise in final sales.
The labor market has been similarly disappointing.
The March unemployment rate of 8.2% was nearly three percentage points above what most economists would consider a desirable and sustainable long-run level rate.
Although the rate was down from 9% a year ago, about half of the change reflected a rise in the number of people who have stopped looking for work, rather than an increase in job creation and the employment rate.
Indeed, the official unemployment rate understates the weakness of the labor market.
An estimated 6% of all employees are working fewer hours per week than they would like, and about 2% of potential employees are not counted as unemployed because they have not looked for work in the past few weeks, even though they would like to work.
Adding these individuals to those officially classified as unemployed implies that about 15% of potential labor-force participants are working less than they want.
Solid increases in payroll employment at the start of the year contributed to a general sense of confidence.
But the rate of increase in payroll employment fell in March to less than half of the rate recorded in previous months, and the number of workers claiming unemployment benefits recently jumped to a four-month high.
Even those who are working are seeing their incomes shrink.
Real average weekly earnings have fallen in recent months, and are now lower than they were 18 months ago.
The broader measure of real per capita after-tax personal income has also been falling, and is back to levels last seen a year ago.
Despite their declining incomes, households raised their spending in early 2012 at a rapid pace by cutting their saving rate to just 3.7%.
Without further declines in the saving rate from this very low level, consumer spending will not continue to grow as robustly.
Recent reports of declining consumer confidence reinforce the likelihood that spending will slow in the months ahead.
Moreover, the housing market remains in bad shape.
The most reliable index of comparable house prices has continued to decline month after month, and prices are now about 7% lower in real terms than a year ago, implying a $1 trillion loss of household wealth.
With roughly 25% of all homeowners with mortgages owing more than their homes are worth, the decline in house prices reflects high rates of default and foreclosure.
Falling prices, together with stricter lending standards, has spurred a shift by would-be home buyers to the rental market, causing recent declines in the sales of both new and existing homes.
The weakness of America's economy is not limited to the household sector.
Industrial production has been unchanged for the past two months, and utilization of industrial capacity has declined.
And the monthly purchasing surveys conducted by the Institute for Supply Management now indicate weaker activity among service firms as well.
Looking ahead, strong headwinds imply that it will be difficult to achieve better economic performance in the rest of the year.
Higher energy prices are reducing real household spending on non-energy goods and services; weakness in Europe and Asia will hurt America's exports; state and local governments are cutting their spending; and concerns about higher taxes in 2013 will dampen both business investment and big-ticket consumer spending.
The economy is thus shaping up to be a serious liability for President Barack Obama, who is likely to place the blame on the conditions that he inherited from President George W. Bush, and on the Republican majority in the House of Representatives.
But the public is likely to place the blame on the president, and surveys indicate that a growing number of Americans believe that Mitt Romney, the almost certain Republican candidate, would do a better job than Obama at managing the economy.
The polls are very close, and voters have not yet locked in their decisions.
The economy could rise more sharply than expected in the months ahead.
If not, Obama will try to shift attention from the overall economy by emphasizing his plan to raise taxes on high-income individuals.
And a variety of other issues, including immigration and the role of women, might influence voters.
But the state of the economy is usually the most important determinant of who wins national elections in the United States.
And US economic conditions now favor Romney.
The Economy of Fear
The global economy seems to be walking on water, shrugging off soaring oil prices, policy paralysis in Europe, unsustainable borrowing by the United States, and record housing prices.
Is it because, as G-8 leaders would have us believe, investors are in a buoyant mood, confident in their leaders" stewardship of the global economy?
Or are we being governed by a pathology of fear, fed by events such as the recent London bombings, that is holding down long-term interest rates thereby covering up a host of simmering problems?
The role of phenomenally low long-term (inflation-adjusted) interest rates in covering up a multitude of weaknesses in the global economy is all too apparent.
Soaring house prices worldwide are propping up consumer demand in many countries, and, according to a recent study by the International Monetary Fund, continually falling long-term interest rates explain two-thirds or more of the global price rise.
Europe has benefited less, but its economies would be a lot worse off if long-term interest rates climbed back to their 25-year average.
Similarly, Latin America has been booming in recent years, despite high debt burdens and a mixed record of policy reform.
Low long-term interest rates have kept the region's debts manageable, while high consumer demand has helped bid up prices for the region's commodity exports.
Why hasn't the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees, as it has on so many other occasions?
Again, the answer is low interest rates.
Ordinarily, a sharp rise in oil prices quickly translates into higher inflation expectations, followed by rising interest rates at all maturities.
But this time, even as the US Federal Reserve keeps hiking its short-term lending rate to keep inflation in line, long-term interest rates - which are far more important - have been magically declining.
Indeed, America has been the single biggest beneficiary of this freakish low-interest-rate environment, with everyone seeming to borrow money like it is going out of style.
Homeowners, backed by rising house prices, are piling up debt.
The Federal government has thrown fiscal prudence out the window.
The country as a whole is absorbing an astounding three-quarters of global excess savings.
But, as long as interest rates remain low and growth high, Americans can laugh at predictions that their excesses are laying the seeds of ruin.
But if low long-term interest rates are helping so many economies walk on water, why are rates so low, and will they stay that way?
Perhaps the situation is far more fragile than many policymakers would have us believe.
Perhaps people have come to feel less , not more, secure about their long-term future, either because of fears about terrorism, a global pandemic, or a severe rash of financial crises.
I am not claiming that investors are hysterical, just that they may have become a bit more concerned about the long-term outlook.
As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.
Other convincing explanations are lacking.
To be sure, emerging markets have been on an unusual savings spree, rebuilding reserves and improving balance sheets, but nobody expects this to go on forever.
Even US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ordinarily the Oracle of Delphi on interest-rate matters, has declared the current situation "a conundrum."
History suggests that the global technology boom has yet to play itself out, with US productivity gains likely to radiate out across the world, raising growth rates everywhere.
Ordinarily, rapid global growth translates into high long-term interest rates - that is, unless, deep down, people have become nervous.
Suppose investors are worried about a small chance of catastrophe over the next five to ten years.
 (According to experts on nuclear terrorism and pandemics, the dangers are real.) 
Suppose investors believe that growth will probably continue to be strong, but that maybe - just maybe - things will fall apart.
In this case, it is entirely possible to have very low interest rates co-exist with strong growth.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950"s and early 1960"s, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.
Since that was a golden era for global growth, why worry if we are seeing the same phenomenon today?
What the optimists forget is that the 1950"s and 1960"s were also a period of massive insecurity.
Many people realistically feared the outbreak of World War III - and with good reason, according to many historians.
Back then, the specter of the Apocalypse helped keep borrowing cheap.
Happily, investors" darkest fears were not realized, and we can only hope for the same.
But if insecurity is a major undercurrent of today's record-low interest rates, then G-8 leaders should be more cautious in their self-congratulation.
Investors" collective psychology is notoriously fragile.
If they ever calm down, interest rates will shoot up, and that could well bring the global economy's simmering imbalances to a raging boil.
The Education Myth
We all know that more education is a Good Thing, especially for our economic futures.
This is why many countries, particularly in Europe, have numerical targets driving their education policies: 50% participation in post-secondary education in the UK or Sweden, for example, or 80% to baccalaureate level in France.
Chancellor Schroeder's big idea for solving Germany's economic problems is, of course, education: including yet more undergraduates in a system struggling to cope with those it has.&#160; 
Governments see their main job as delivering economic prosperity, and they view education as a necessary and reliable tool for achieving that end.
But is it?
We are told that in a "knowledge economy," a country needs ever more graduates and formal qualifications to stay competitive.
But education simply does not deliver economic growth the way our politicians - and businessmen - believe: more education in does not mean more growth out.
Worse, the education policies that follow from current beliefs have serious negative consequences for opportunities for young people and the quality of education itself.
The argument that education matters for the economy is plausible because, at one level, it is obviously right.
A modern society does need educated people: not just engineers, chemists, and doctors, but millions of people who can write coherent letters, fill in complicated forms, explain insurance policies, and interpret statistical data from machines on factory floors.
Some of these skills can be learned only in universities; others can (and should) be mastered in primary and secondary schools.
Employers naturally tend to hire the most educated workers on offer, and so as the number of graduates increase, so does the number of "graduate" jobs.
However, every study I know of - whether British, Scandinavian, or American - agrees that large numbers of these "graduate" jobs require no more than they did when non-graduates performed them perfectly well.
In this sense, many societies are already "over-educated."
But perhaps this is irrelevant.
Maybe better-educated workers do their jobs more efficiently, in which case we will surely find a clear relationship between educational attainment and economic growth.
Alas, no.
A few recently industrialized countries have pursued successful government-driven education strategies that seem to boost economic development.
But for every such case - South Korea is the favorite example - there is another, like Hong Kong, where meteoric economic growth had nothing to do with centrally planned education policy.
Instead, parents pushed their children towards the best schools to give them an individual head start - something parents do the world over - only after they got richer.
Moreover, for every South Korea, and every Hong Kong, we can also find developing countries where expanding education merely fueled competition for white-collar jobs in a bloated, deadweight state bureaucracy.
Countries like this explain why large international studies often find a negative relationship between education and growth rates. 
Egypt is a classic example of this. Between 1970 and 1998, its primary school enrollment rates grew to over 90%, secondary schooling soared from 32% to 75%, and university education doubled.
Egypt started the period as the world's 47th poorest country; it ended the period as the 48th poorest.
But it is not only among developing countries that links between education and growth prove elusive.
Switzerland has been one of the richest countries in the world for a century - and not because of its natural resources.
Yet it has the lowest rate of university attendance in Western Europe. 
If you look for a relationship between children's performance on international surveys of achievement, and their countries" growth rates twenty years on, you will look in vain.
No such relationship exists.
So, while any developed country obviously needs an educated population, the idea that having the most education will get you the most prosperity is a chimera.
Does this matter, though?
Surely, education has other virtues, over and above its economic role.
So maybe we should stop criticizing and start celebrating governments" enthusiasm for spending on education.
But this would ignore the dark underside of our educational spiral.
The creation of more "graduate" jobs only proves that as credentials become more common, they become more important.
Moreover, in the past, someone who left school without the "right" qualifications could still succeed, through an apprenticeship or by working his way up from the shop floor.
Today, that is becoming impossible: we are creating societies in which the sheep and the goats are marked for life in their teens.
As university attendance becomes more common, fewer capable young people enter vocational training.
Yet our economies still need highly trained craftspeople far more than another batch of arts graduates.
Moreover, rapid expansion of university education all too often comes at the expense of quality.
Education is expensive because it uses people: there are no vast economies of scale or leaps in productivity.
Relative pay for teachers has been dropping as their total numbers increase, which affects teacher quality.
University classes become larger, which means that students are taught less effectively.
It becomes harder to maintain good university-based research because of the demands of other parts of the education budget.&#160; 
Is this really the best route to a vibrant economy and a civilized, cultured, and open society?
Reefer Madness?
LONDON - Is cannabis harmful to mental health?
That question has provoked much debate over the years, often generating more heat than light.
The bottom line is this: within the scientific community, there is a general consensus that most people who use cannabis will not develop significant mental-health problems.
Certain individuals, however, are more susceptible to the negative effects of its use.
It was long thought that cannabis was a relatively harmless drug, and that concerns about its use were overstated.
Some psychiatrists had reported that excessive use could lead to a psychotic state, including hallucinations, delusions, and thought disturbance.
But the first significant indication of a link between cannabis use and psychotic illness came only in 1987, from a large Swedish study that followed more than 50,000 subjects over 15 years.
Reported cannabis use at the study's start increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with schizophrenia in the next 15 years.
The greater the use, the higher the likelihood of being diagnosed.
Curiously, this finding did not spur much interest, and no similar studies were reported until 2002.
Since then, however, many studies have explored the association between cannabis use and psychotic illness.
In 2007, a compilation of the best studies concluded that frequent (daily) cannabis use doubles the risk of a psychotic outcome.
Since the lifetime prevalence of a psychotic illness is roughly 1% of the population, daily cannabis use would increase this to 2%.
Of course, the existence of a positive correlation between cannabis use and psychosis does not allow us to draw a direct causal link between the two.
Psychosis could cause cannabis use, rather than vice versa, or an unknown mediating factor could cause both cannabis use and psychosis.
Other factors already complicate the relationship.
For example, the age at which cannabis use begins appears to be an important factor.
People who started using cannabis before the age of 16 have a higher risk of psychosis compared to those who start after 18.
This is in line with biological evidence suggesting that the maturing brain is more susceptible to the negative impact of cannabis.
Recent research has shown that a particular variant of a gene called AKT1 mediates the risk of psychosis.
For carriers of the C/C variant (which occurs in roughly 20% of the population), the risk of psychosis increased seven-fold - but only for the people who used cannabis every day.
Using cannabis on weekends or less often posed no increased risk, which was also the case for daily and weekend use among carriers of the C/T and T/T variants of AKT1.
Moreover, different strains of cannabis pose more or less risk for psychosis.
A comparison of the two most common types of cannabis in the United Kingdom, hash and sinsemilla ("skunk"), found that using skunk implied a significantly greater risk of psychosis, while hash did not.
The explanation for this difference lies in the composition of the two main components of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).
Skunk in the UK has high levels of THC while being virtually devoid of CBD; hash, on the other hand, has roughly equal quantities of the two components.
This was highlighted in our lab when healthy volunteers were given either pure THC or THC and CBD. Those who received only THC had a significant increase in paranoid thoughts, psychotic symptoms, and memory impairment, while those who received the combination experienced no paranoia, had fewer psychotic symptoms, and maintained memory function.
Some studies have also explored the role of cannabis use in disorders such as depression and anxiety.
While little sign of a link has been found, there is better evidence for the addictive potential of cannabis.
Roughly 10% of people who smoke cannabis go on to develop dependence, which produces withdrawal symptoms when use is stopped, such as craving, irritability, sleep disturbances, abdominal pain, and nervousness.
Again, CBD seems to offset the addictive effects of cannabis, and seems to provide relief from withdrawal symptoms.
Many studies have focused on the possible negative impact of cannabis use on memory and other cognitive functions.
It is generally accepted that frequent and prolonged cannabis use impairs cognitive functioning, but that these effects are reversible following abstinence of 3-12 months.
However, a recent study that followed people from birth to age 38 found that those who started using cannabis early, every day, and for several years had a permanent 8-point drop in IQ scores.
 (The study has not yet been replicated.) 
A final, and often-overlooked, source of harm to mental health associated with cannabis is the legal fallout of being caught with it.
Penalties for cannabis possession range from none (for example, the Netherlands and Portugal) to legal warnings, fines, and even life imprisonment (Southeast Asia).
A criminal record can negatively affect future employment, education, and ability to travel.
Such consequences may carry independent risks to mental health; for example, unemployment poses a significant risk for suicide, anxiety, depression, and psychosis.
So, does cannabis use harm mental health?
Yes and no.
Much depends on how old you are when you start, your genes, and how much, how often, and what kind you use - and, of course, on whether you get caught.
The Egyptian Crucible
MADRID - As Egyptians tensely awaited the results of their country's presidential elections, a thread of pessimism ran through the discourse of the young people and secular liberals who had brought down Hosni Mubarak in January 2011.
The "anything is possible" sensation of the Tahrir Square rebellion had faded, and now two candidates whom the protesters deeply opposed, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi, and Ahmed Shafiq, a factotum of the old regime (and of the current military government), prepared to face off in the second round.
The triad of fundamental forces driving Egypt since the beginning of the Arab Spring - the military, the mosque, and the masses in Tahrir Square, each with different types of power and interests - was thus broken.
Those who filled Tahrir Square 16 months ago were silenced, and the expected transfer of power from the military to a civilian, democratic government was thrown into doubt.
Since assuming power after Mubarak's fall, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, a defense minister for two decades under Mubarak, has consistently undermined the delicate work of democratic transition.
The week before the presidential elections, the SCAF-allied Constitutional Court dissolved the recently elected parliament, alleging illegality in the voting process.
And, foreseeing Morsi's victory, SCAF assumed all legislative powers; severely limited the president's powers; seized the authority to appoint the committee tasked with drafting the new Constitution; took control of the country's budget; and claimed sole power over domestic and foreign security.
As a result, Egypt's power struggle will continue, with the junta no longer battling those in Tahrir Square, but political Islam.
After a decades-long clandestine (although tolerated) existence within Egyptian society, Islamist forces were able to take advantage of the Tahrir protests, despite playing no integral part in them.
The secular liberal forces" political fragmentation and lack of organization cost them dearly in the parliamentary elections six months ago, and, in the second round of the presidential election, a majority of Egyptians chose Morsi over a restoration of the old regime.
But Morsi's narrow margin of victory (just 3.5 percentage points) over Shafiq, and low voter turnout - 46.4% in the first round and 51.8% in the second - reflect a polarized, exhausted society that lacks confidence in the electoral process and the candidates.
Moreover, the outcome has merely fueled further uncertainty about Egypt's direction.
With Morsi's victory, some now fear that the Muslim Brotherhood will seek to implement radical policies aimed at Islamizing a Muslim country that is already conservative, but that has had a secular government for decades.
Others do not believe that the Muslim Brotherhood will go so far, but nonetheless doubt that the Brothers will defend a secular, truly democratic regime in the ongoing negotiations with SCAF on a transition to civilian rule.
In either scenario, Morsi has little room to maneuver in a country that, for the time being, is in political limbo - with neither a constitution nor a parliament - and whose people want tangible results in terms of good governance, institutional consolidation, and improvements to a tottering economy.
Indeed, living standards have been under severe pressure since Mubarak's downfall.
In 2011 alone, net capital inflows fell nearly 90% year on year, tourism was down 30%, the trade deficit soared to $28 billion, and GDP growth slowed from 3.8% to 1%.
The success or failure of Morsi's government will rest largely on the economy.
For the Muslim Brotherhood, this scenario constitutes a serious challenge, one that can be overcome only by finding an adequate balance between SCAF, with its overweening power, and Egypt's liberal political forces - which won a combined 11 million votes, five million more than Morsi, in the presidential election's first round.
Only this will give a Morsi administration the necessary legitimacy and capacity to carry out a joint transition with the military for a true change of regime.
The liberals, for their part, did not support Morsi in the run-off with Shafiq.
But it was their efforts that made the presidential election possible in the first place, and many now believe that close collaboration with the Brothers is the only available option that can restore some of the spirit of an endangered revolution in which they were the protagonists.
This presupposes that the Brothers reorganize themselves internally and find ways to distance themselves from more radical factions, and that they promote inclusive policies toward vulnerable groups and social minorities.
For now, the Brothers have announced that they will name a Christian and a woman as Vice Presidents.
Obviously, that represents an encouraging first step in bridging Egypt's divides.
But, just as obviously, it is only a first step.
The Egyptian Endgame
PRINCETON - Can Egypt's long history help us to understand the uprising, already labeled a revolution, now underway in Cairo, and how it might turn out?
I believe so.
After all, the demonstrations by millions of people to demand an end to the rule of President Hosni Mubarak and his National Democratic Party (NDP) are not an unprecedented phenomenon in the country.
Egypt's history is replete with powerful and famous rulers (starting with Ramses II in pharaonic times, and including Saladin, Muhammad Ali, Napoleon Bonaparte, Lord Cromer, all the way up to the Egyptian military trio of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar El Sadat, and Mubarak).
This suggests that, although Egyptians may not necessarily prefer strongman rule, they are entirely comfortable with it and may even believe that it is necessary.
To be sure, popular revolts are nothing new for Egypt.
Crowds rose against Napoleon's French forces in 1798, against the monarchy in 1881-1882, against British dominance in 1919 and 1952, against Sadat in 1977, and against Mubarak in 1986.
These uprisings were repressed, often brutally, first by foreign troops (the French army in 1798 and British soldiers in 1882 and 1919) and more recently by the Egyptian army.
Unfortunately, while angry protesters have sometimes forced unwelcome rulers out of power, they have been unable to replace tyrants with governments that respect the public's wishes.
Will this long history of authoritarian rule now be broken?
The first days of the current uprising favored the people.
The crowds were enormous and peaceful, not only in Cairo, the historic node for protest, but in all of Egypt's cities.
In addition, the army, called out ostensibly to restore order, held back, a markedly different response from its repression of past uprisings.
French and British soldiers did not hesitate to put down resistance. Nor did the Egyptian army in 1952, 1977, and 1986.
The uprising in 1952 is particularly revealing, because it was widespread and intensely popular, for it was directed against the much-hated British.
Although the British had 100,000 troops stationed near the Suez Canal at the time, they chose not to intervene.
Instead, it was the small and highly professional Egyptian army that crushed the uprising, to the dismay of the young officer corps, who were already well advanced in their plans to seize power.
Years of fighting in Arab-Israeli conflicts, however, transformed the army, giving rise to a massive conscript force that totals approximately 400,000 soldiers today.
The army's lower ranks are now filled with young men, drawn from all segments of Egyptian society, whose backgrounds are no different from those of the people they may be called upon to suppress.
Today's Egyptian army is a people's army, and, unlike the reviled security forces, it is widely admired.
Senior officers surely know the risks that they will incur if they order these men to fire on friends and relatives.
Moreover, the current mass demonstrations are radically different from previous protest movements that the army suppressed.
In 1977, many rose to oppose an end to food and other consumer subsidies; in 1986, poorly paid security forces went on a rampage.
The numbers involved in those protests were miniscule compared to now.
Nor were the protesters" actions peaceful.
They threatened property and undermined political order from the outset.
The Egyptian high command did not need to worry that rank-and-file soldiers would disobey orders, because they were protecting the citizenry.
Yet, the current protest, which started so peacefully and with such ebullience, took a dramatic and violent turn several days ago.
Mubarak's promise that he would not run for re-election this coming September, which might have mollified his critics two weeks earlier, was no longer enough.
When this concession failed, Mubarak and the ruling NDP began to work behind the scenes, encouraging their followers to attack protesters and provoke violence.
But Mubarak has also prepared the way for a new set of leaders - all strongly committed to the old order.
Almost all of them are high-ranking military officers, now elevated to the government's most important offices.
Generals now hold the positions of Vice-President, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of the Interior.
Nor are the anti-government protesters likely to find robust support from the United States, always deeply involved in Egyptian affairs, regardless of how often President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasize America's commitment to freedom and democracy.
Yes, the Americans want Mubarak to leave - and quickly.
But the anchor of US policy in the Middle East is the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, negotiated by Sadat in 1979, maintained by Mubarak, and well liked by Egypt's military high command, which controls the strongest Arab army, is US-trained, and has been supplied with top-shelf American weaponry.
A popular government in which the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood is represented would worry the Americans and the Egyptian military, owing to the prospect that it would repudiate the peace treaty with Israel and jeopardize relations with the US.
But that is not the most immediate concern.
Should violence increase, ordinary soldiers would likely once again feel duty-bound to intervene to restore order and prevent further bloodshed.
If not, the prospects for a transition to a government formed by leaders of the much-respected Egyptian army and moderates representing business and political elites seem high.
The Eighteenth Brumaire of Arnold Schwarzenegger
Replacing a governor whom they re-elected only a year before with Arnold Schwarzenegger must have given Californian voters an enormous--if guilty--pleasure.
Some members of the opposition in Germany would dearly love to do the same to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, though they have not (yet!) found a film star to replace him.
Several other European governments find themselves in a similar state of unpopularity not long after being elected.
Beyond Europe this is true even for the recently acclaimed Brazilian President Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva, to say nothing of Mexican President Vicente Fox and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, the latter having called for a referendum to help arrest his sinking popularity.
Electoral success, it appears, fades fast nowadays.
So should every country adopt a recall procedure to maintain the legitimacy of governments?
Absolutely not.
Democracy, in the words of the philosopher Karl Popper, is about being able to remove those in power without violence; it is in this sense about trial and error.
But leaders must be given the chance to govern.
Indeed, they need a chance to make mistakes and to learn and recover from their errors, as long as their decisions do not affect the foundations of the democratic order itself.
Trial and error implies the opportunity to err before we try again.
Californian voters' first mistake is thus what may be called "the lure of the immediate"--none too surprising in a state where instant gratification is supposedly a core value.
But sometimes this desire seems overwhelming in post-modern democracies everywhere.
Indeed, democracy nowadays has embraced a pop culture of rapidly passing fads; today's hysteria-generating pop group is forgotten tomorrow, and there are always more waiting in the wings.
In politics this can be dangerous, because it encourages basing decisions, no matter how weighty, on whatever popular opinion momentarily prevails.
The call for more referenda both reflects and fuels this trend.
Referenda are for the most part snapshots.
Switzerland, with its generally slower pace and its thorough political debates before votes are held, may be the exception.
As a rule however, referenda measure the popularity of political leaders at a particular moment, regardless of the issue at stake.
If and when Britain votes on joining the Euro, the result will most likely tell us all sorts of things about Tony Blair and about the European Union, but little about the merits of the common currency.
So the case for representative government remains strong.
Democracy is government by debate, by taking important decisions after thorough deliberation of the kind that--at least in large countries--must be conducted in a parliament through elected representatives.
Sometimes parliaments wish to act quickly, and perhaps must do so, but as a rule they take enough time to examine issues fully.
Parliaments talk before reaching conclusions; hence their name.
Consider Germany, where some leaders of the opposition Christian Democrats yearn to sink the Schröder government.
Clearly, the reforms proposed and already partly enacted by the government are unpopular, and there is little doubt that, a year after their re-election, the coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens would not stand much of a chance at the polls.
But who knows what the electorate will think in three years, at the end of the government's full term in office?
By the time of the next regularly scheduled election, it could become clear that there were no real alternatives to Schröder's policies, and it could even be the case that the predicted beneficial effects of painful reforms will become apparent by then.
Leadership needs time to take and implement unpopular decisions as well as popular ones.
Leaders themselves need the nerve to take often precarious parliamentary majorities through the troughs of popularity.
This is why they should commit their cruelest deeds in the first year and soften up as the next election approaches.
The uneasy partnership of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown is a good example of this tactic.
Leaders who never risk their popularity are not worth their position.
So California has set a bad example, and Californians will probably pay a heavy price for it.
They may not pay as heavy a price as France a century and a half ago, when the popularly elected Louis Napoleon transformed himself, via a wildly popular referendum, into Napoleon III--that vote being the last the French would enjoy until the end of the Second Empire.
Californians, of course, won't be disenfranchised, but their willfulness threatens to yield a wayward and irresponsible form of state politics.
To be sure, democracy implies limiting the time that the powerful have to exercise their power without challenge.
An effective democracy must give them enough time to win the support of those elected to legislate and to carry out their program.
These two imperatives are inherently contradictory, but the balance between them is still best achieved through representative, parliamentary democracy.
Anything else is likely to be about as stable as this week's top ten pop songs.
Menjamin Masa Depan yang Berkelanjutan
LONDON - Saat Karl Marx dan Friedrich Engels menulis bahwa "Segala yang padat hilang larut dalam udara," pernyataan ini dimaksudkan sebagai sebuah metafora perubahan akibat revolusi industri yang merusak norma-norma sosial yang sudah terbentuk.
Saat ini, pernyataan mereka dapat diartikan secara harafiah: Emisi karbon dioksida dan polutan-polutan industri lainnya yang dikeluarkan ke atmosfer telah merubah planet ini - dengan dampak yang besar bagi lingkungan hidup, kesehatan, perpindahan penduduk, dan keadilan sosial.
Dunia kini berada pada sebuah persimpangan, dan banyak kemajuan yang telah kita buat dalam bidang-bidang tersebut dapat hilang seketika.
Pada tahun 2007, Nelson Mandela mendirikan The Elders untuk menghadapi resiko-resiko tersebut, meminta kelompok independen yang terdiri dari mantan pemimpin formal untuk menyampaikan kebenaran pada pemegang kekuasaan saat ini atau ���speak truth unto power."
Inilah yang akan kita lakukan pada peluncuran Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) atau Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan yang baru dalam Sidang Umum PBB pada bulan ini.
SDG akan melanjutkan Millennium Development Goals (MDG) atau Tujuan Pembangunan Milenium yang memandu upaya-upaya pembangunan internasional tahun 2000-2015.
MDG telah menolong berjuta-juta orang keluar dari buta aksara, penyakit, kelaparan, dan menempatkan pembangunan sebagai inti agenda politik global.
Namun demikian, dampak keseluruhannya sering dinilai tidak cukup, khususnya di negara-negara yang rentan atau sedang mengalami konflik - dan MDG telah gagal memasukkan keberlanjutan di dalam targetnya.
SDG mewakili sebuah kemajuan yang besar karena melihat kesamaan hubungan yang penting diantara tantangan-tantangan tersebut - termasuk kemiskinan dengan segala bentuknya, ketidaksetaraan gender, perubahan iklim, dan tata kelola yang buruk - yang harus diselesaikan secara bersamaan.
Tujuh belas tujuan yang berbeda mungkin terlihat sulit diwujudkan, namun dampak kumulatifnya berarti tidak ada topik atau wilayah dari hal tersebut yang luput dari perhatian.
Pada akhirnya, keberlanjutan diintegrasikan ke dalam pembangunan global, sejalan dengan apa yang telah dikampanyekan selama beberapa dekade.
Sebagai mantan pemimpin dari bagian dunia Utara dan Selatan, kami senang bahwa SDG akan diberlakukan bagi semua negara anggota PBB dan bukan hanya negara berkembang.
Dengan cara ini, kami berharap bahwa SDG akan bersifat "universal" seperti Deklarasi Universal mengenai Hak Asasi Manusia - sebuah elemen penting sebagai senjata masyarakat dalam perjuangan menuju keadilan.
Implementasi dan akuntabilitas adalah kuncinya.
Kata-kata indah saja tidak cukup; para pemimpin harus berkomitmen dan membuatnya menjadi kenyataan melalui tindakan, dan masyarakat harus rajin memantau perkembangan dan membunyikan peluit saat upaya yang dilakukan tidak cukup.
Sering deklarasi-deklarasi dalam pertemuan puncak menguap saat para delegasi kembali ke negaranya dan kepentingan politik jangka pendek lebih diutamakan.
Saat ini, taruhannya besar.
Keputusan-keputusan yang diambil pada tahun ini, pada pertemuan puncak SDG dan konferensi iklim di Paris pada bulan Desember, akan memiliki dampak yang besar bagi masa depan planet kita.
Iklim yang stabil menjamin kesejahteraan, penurunan kemiskinan, dan supremasi hukum.
Jika para pemimpin dunia di Paris tidak menyetujui langkah-langkah yang diperlukan untuk menjaga kenaikan suhu agar tidak sampai dua derajat Celsius, maka SDG tidak dapat diwujudkan.
Kita tidak sedang menghadapi pilihan antara pengentasan kemiskinan dan penanggulangan perubahan iklim, seperti yang dikatakan oleh berbagai perusahaan bahan bakar fosil.
Memang benar, dampak-dampak berbahaya akibat perubahan iklim mengancam hasil-hasil pembangunan yang sudah kita dapatkan melalui dukungan MDG.
Kita memiliki resiko bumi yang makin sesak karena gelombang panas, kekeringan yang merajalela, banjir yang merusak, dan kebakaran hutan yang mematikan.
Seluruh daerah dapat mengalami penurunan produksi makanan besar-besaran.
Permukaan air laut akan naik, kota-kota besar dan negara-negara pulau kecil akan tenggelam.
Sebagian besar populasi akan kehilangan lahan dan memperburuk kesulitan ekonomi dan tekanan sosial.
Pada saat yang sama, muncul kesepakatan - antara berbagai organisasi akar rumput dan bank sentral - bahwa ketidaksetaraan menyebabkan ancaman serius pada penghidupan dan kesejahteraan masyarakat di seluruh dunia.
Globalisasi telah menyebabkan lemahnya kontrak sosial di dalam negara-bangsa dan bahkan antar benua.
Jawaban dari ketidaksetaraan bukanlah dengan membangun dinding, menumpuk kekayaan, dan memberi stigma pada orang miskin dan lemah.
Kesejahteraan yang berkelanjutan mensyaratkan semua kelompok di dalam masyarakat membagikan secara adil keuntungan dari pertumbuhan ekonomi - khususnya saat masyarakat kita menjadi makin saling bergantung.
Untuk alasan ini, kami khususnya terdorong oleh Tujuan 10 di SDG dengan komitmennya untuk mengurangi ketimpangan antar negara, juga berfokus pada kesetaraan gender dalam implementasi seluruh tujuannya.
Kita mengetahui bahwa kerangka maupun proses apapun memiliki keterbatasan.
Berbagai pertemuan puncak internasional sering dilakukan dengan cara yang asing bagi orang-orang di luar ruang konferensi.
Pada tahun 1980an, PBB menghasilkan apa yang dikenal dengan nama Laporan Brundtland untuk menjawab keresahan global mengenai tren rusaknya lingkungan hidup, sosial, dan ekonomi.
Laporan tersebut mendefinisikan konsep "pembangunan berkelanjutan" dan menyerukan perubahan radikal.
Laporan tersebut memperingatkan bahwa, "Jika kita tidak mengejawantahkan kata-kata kita menjadi bahasa yang dapat menyentuh hati dan pikiran berbagai orang muda dan tua, kita tidak akan dapat melakukan perubahan sosial yang besar yang diperlukan untuk memperbaiki arah pembangunan."
Berbagai kebijakan pembangunan dan pertumbuhan yang berkelanjutan tidak dapat dilakukan dengan membuat dekrit saja; dekrit harus dirumuskan dan dilaksanakan dengan memperhatikan pandangan dan pengalaman masyarakat biasa.
Untuk menerapkan SDG dan mengurangi perubahan iklim, perubahan besar diperlukan untuk beranjak dari model ekonomi kita yang bergantung pada bahan bakar fosil.
Pemahaman dan persetujuan publik penting dalam hal ini.
Para pemimpin dunia harus memiliki keberanian untuk mengambil keputusan yang tegas, menjelaskan kebutuhan mereka, dan mengimplementasikannya dengan cara yang adil dan efektif.
Mereka tidak punya hak untuk meniadakan masa depan yang baik bagi cucu kita.
Ini bukan lagi pertanyaan mengenai pilihan, melainkan kewajiban untuk menghindari bencana.
Inilah waktunya untuk mengambil tindakan.
Kita tidak boleh membiarkan kesempatan ini hilang begitu saja.
The Electronic Money Revolution
Most journalistic accounts of the new forms of electronic money misleadingly spin the story as the emergence of yet another convenience for the technologically pampered.
So what if we can pull out a "smart card" rather than carry coins?
Big deal.
These new forms of money sound like power windows on cars, or remote control for TV sets.
Maybe we'd be better off without these gadgets.
But media coverage has failed to look far enough into the future, and to comprehend the full extent of the changes that will be wrought by new forms of electronic money, as people and businesses invent new ways of doing business.
Electronic money is not a channel changer: as it develops, it will help transform the world economy.
Two benefits of electronic money stand out, and will likely contribute to its growth. Most important, it will have profound intellectual benefits by creating incentives for the active pursuit of ideas.
Second, electronic money will advance globalization , expanding the scope and versatility of the Internet and making it easier for people to interact constructively with others around the world.
Taken together, these two benefits will enable millions of minds to work together far more effectively than ever before.
To understand electronic money's potential significance, consider the invention of coins, the first form of true money, in Lydia (now Turkey) in the seventh century BC and, independently, in China.
This was an important advance, and thus one that spread quickly.
The reason is straightforward. Before the invention of coins, commerce depended on precious metals.
But the amounts had to be cut to the size of the transaction and weighed out with balance scales.
People had to carry the scales, accompanying weights, and sometimes even tools to cut the metal, just to be able to transact.
Archeologists still find elaborate (and probably expensive in those days) two-pan balance scales and weights on sunken bronze-age merchant ships.
Most people didn't have them.
Another difficulty with using undifferentiated precious metals for exchange was that some trust or expertise was required to assure people that the metal was pure.
The same problem occurred with other commodities that people tried to use for exchange, such as gems or shells; their value was too uncertain.
As a result of these obstacles, it was hard to carry out small transactions before the invention of standardized and identical coins, and trade must have been largely confined to big deals between major parties.
With the introduction of coins, it became possible to develop many new kinds of business.
One could easily establish and operate a business selling food by the serving or providing small household items to anyone who happened to pass by.
But, most importantly, the invention of coins greatly enhanced the spread of knowledge. After the invention of coins, it became easy to sell books, lessons, and instructions.
The development of coins is part of the reason that both the classical world around ancient Lydia and China in the Han Dynasty were so advanced compared to other parts of the world.
The lesson is that the magnitude of transaction costs and contracting costs ultimately determine much of an economy's structure.
As new forms of money reduce these costs, the richness and complexity of our economy will be increased.
Lower transaction costs mean that exchange can be dramatically more fine-grained.
With the latest forms of electronic money we can sell millions of little things, to millions of different people all over the world.
Nowhere is this more important than in the realm of ideas.
Credit card companies now routinely charge the firms accepting credit card payments US$0.25 plus between two and three percent of the amount transferred per payment.
This fee structure makes it difficult to run a business selling items for less than ten dollars, and impossible to run a business selling items for less than one dollar: transaction costs eat up the profits.
Through superior payments software, micropayments companies like Paypal (founded in 1998), Yaga (founded in 2000), Peppercoin (founded in 2001) and BitPass (founded in 2002) are able to offer much lower transaction costs than credit card companies, greatly expanding the number of transactions.
A company can now charge people less than a dollar for a service (such as viewing a web page), and get significant returns by high volume.
There are skeptics who say that the public is resistant to buying digital content, because people are accustomed to getting it for free.
That is what people used to say years ago about cable TV.
Excellent TV programming is not given away for free. Neither are other substantial intellectual creations.
These skeptics overlook the profound changes that new technologies gradually make in our habits as we discover their possibilities.
Already, we have seen the success of Apple's iTunes, which sells music for US$0.99 per song.
Created in 2003, the iTunes Music Store recently surpassed its 100 millionth sale. That is certainly high volume.
What iTunes sells is one form of intellectual content.
Other forms will follow.
It will be exciting to see what new forms of intellectual content are invented in coming years and decades.
The economic revolution - both online and offline - that will be triggered as we learn how to use electronic money may be as profound as that wrought by our ancient ancestors' invention of coins.
The Elephant's Choices
New Delhi - A month after they first queued to vote in India's mammoth general election, the country's voters will learn the outcome on May 16.
The election, staggered over five phases - involving five polling days over four weeks, rather than one "election day" - will determine who rules the world's largest democracy.
Only one thing is certain: no single party will win a majority on its own.
India is set for more coalition rule.
That may not be a bad thing.
India's last two governments each served a full term and presided over significant economic growth, even though they comprised 23 and 20 parties, respectively.
Coalition politics gives representation to the myriad interests that make up a diverse and complex society, and ensures that the country as a whole accepts the policies ultimately adopted.
But coalition rule can also often mean governance of the lowest common denominator, as resistance by any of the government's significant members to a policy can delay or even thwart it.
In India's parliamentary system, if a coalition loses its majority, the government falls, and keeping allies together can sometimes prove a greater priority than getting things done.
India's national elections are really an aggregate of thirty different state elections, each influenced by its own local considerations, regional political currents, and different patterns of political incumbency.
Soon after May 16, the largest single party that emerges will seek to construct a coalition out of a diverse array of victors from the various states.
Several outcomes are possible.
The most likely is that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's Indian National Congress, currently leading the government, emerges once again as the largest single party and assembles a new ruling coalition.
The main alternative would be majority alliance put together by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by the 82-year-old Lal Krishna Advani.
But there is a third possibility: a motley collection of regional parties, together with the Communists, gets enough seats to prevent either of the two big parties from forming a government.
In that case, a "hung parliament" could see a "third front" coming to power as a minority government, supported tactically by one of the big parties.
This has happened before - and each time, the government that resulted fell within a year.
Each alternative could have serious implications for India.
Though the big parties are broadly committed to continuing an economic policy of liberalization and growth, the BJP is mostly focused on the well-being of India's merchant class, whereas Congress wishes to redistribute enhanced government revenues to the poor through generous social programs.
The left, which would strongly influence any "third front" government, are staunchly opposed to economic liberalization and wish to strengthen, rather than dilute, India's large public sector.
In foreign policy, India's growing closeness with the United States under both the BJP and the Congress has proved controversial at home, with leftist parties threatening to scrap the Indo-US nuclear deal and break defense ties with Israel if they come to power.
Should the regional parties dominate the government, domestic politics would strongly impact India's foreign policy: the anger of Tamil voters over events in Sri Lanka, or of Muslims over Gaza, would be reflected in the government and therefore constrain policy options.
The BJP has promised a more hawkish security posture than Congress in the wake of the Mumbai terrorist attacks, but when it was in power it conducted itself remarkably similarly to its rival, initiating a peace process with Pakistan.
The biggest differences among the various groupings consist in the tone and tenor of their respective visions of India.
Congress remains a "big tent" party, committed to preserving India's pluralism and conscious of the multiple identities and interests of India's many peoples.
The BJP, which accuses Congress of "appeasing" India's minorities, hews to a staunchly Hindu-chauvinist line, and has received support from some of the most bigoted and intolerant sections of Indian society.
The "third front" involves assorted petty particularisms - parties representing the sectarian interests of specific castes, sub-regions, or linguistic groups.
The danger is that such groups could accentuate the divisions of a fractious society, rather than pull everyone together in the collective national interest.
That would be a startling change from five years ago.
The 2004 elections were won by the Congress party, led by a woman political leader of Roman Catholic faith and Italian descent (Sonia Gandhi), who made way for a Sikh prime minister (Manmohan Singh) to be sworn by a Muslim (President Abdul Kalam) in a country that is 81% Hindu.
That single moment captured much of what elections have meant for this diverse democracy.
But the ultimate reality will remain that of a coalition government trying to make progress in a contentious polity.
In India, policy changes require political consensus within the ruling coalition, labor laws are strongly defended by unions and political parties, and controversial decisions can be challenged on the streets, in the courts, and ultimately at the polls.
Necessary policy reforms advocated by a ruling party are often held hostage to the prejudices of its allies.
So change comes slowly.
But it does come, and once a policy consensus has been established, it tends to be durable.
Indian democracy has often been likened to the stately progress of the elephant - ponderous in its gait and reluctant to change course, but not easily swayed from its new path when it does.
The elephant of Indian democracy will acquire a new set of mahouts before the month's end.
Who they are will have a major impact on the fortunes and prospects of one-sixth of humanity.
That alone makes the election results due on May 16 worth the world's attention.
The Elixir of Education?
Many people see education as a cure-all.
They believe that societies can be transformed by pouring money into raising educational standards.
But, while it is right to believe in the power of education - indeed, many scholars are convinced that it creates healthier, more prosperous citizens - such enthusiasm doesn't tell us how to get more children to stay in school longer, or how to ensure that they learn useful skills while they are there.
Today, virtually every Latin American and Caribbean child enrolls in primary school, and most complete several years of secondary education - remarkable progress compared to a half-century ago.
Yet Latin American and Caribbean children gain fewer skills in each year of school than students do in high-income countries - and even in some other developing countries.
Indigenous children have a significantly lower chance of educational success.
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Paraguay lag behind even other Latin American countries.
Despite the widespread enthusiasm for lifting educational performance in Latin America and the Caribbean, little effort has been devoted to working out how to maximize investments in education.
Which policies work best?
There are myriad options.
The World Bank recommends decentralizing school administration and decision-making so that schools are more responsive to local needs.
But no reliable studies have established this strategy's effectiveness.
Bilingual education is another suggestion that requires further research if we are to establish the benefits.
Research in Africa suggests that giving de-worming medicine to primary school pupils reduces the prevalence of health problems that lower children's concentration and attendance.
A program to provide teachers with monetary incentives and professional training was recently established in Mexico, but research conducted to date has found no significant impact on educational outcomes.
Clearly, there is a deficit of useful information and serious scientific research in this field.
However, three options should be promoted.
First, there is credible evidence that children who are better nourished in their first years of life stay in school longer and learn more each year that they remain there.
This was first demonstrated in the 1960"s, when Guatemalan researchers gave children in two randomly selected villages a nutritious porridge each day, and a much less nutritious fruit drink to children in two other villages.
More recently, Bolivia launched the Proyecto Integral de Desarrollo Infantil (PIDI), which gave low-income urban children food and extra educational activities.
This policy can be very affordable: providing porridge in Guatemala cost just $23.25 per child per year, while the monetary value of the increase in the children's future wages is between two and four times higher.
A second option is Conditional Cash Transfer Programs, which provide cash payments to poor households whose children attend school regularly.
These programs have been shown to increase enrollment and attendance.
Families in some rural communities of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico get monthly cash payments if their children's school attendance rates are 85% or higher.
In Nicaragua, these programs have increased school enrollment rates by about 13 percentage points.
However, such incentives do not address the problem of low-quality education, and research shows that the benefits do not always outweigh the costs.
Policymakers may choose instead to follow the example of Chile and Colombia, which give students government money to pay for private education.
In Colombia, scholarships were provided to 125,000 students from poor, urban communities in the early 1990"s.
Where demand exceeded supply, private education "voucher" recipients were selected by lottery.
Each voucher cost the Colombian government $24 a year more than its previous education spending per student, but the vouchers increased attendance rates and test scores.
It is estimated that children in the program increased their future incomes by $300 per year.
With the benefits exceeding the costs by between 10 and 25 times, this seems to be a sound option.
Yet an analysis of Chile's voucher program found no positive effect on students" test scores or years in school.
Instead, the program's main effect seems to have been to encourage the best students in public schools to switch to private schools.
Investing in education is vital for Latin America and the Caribbean.
But much remains unknown.
Many policy options unravel when examined closely; others show promise but require more study.
The most expensive programs aren't necessarily the most successful.
Merely waxing lyrical about the benefits of education will do nothing to help Latin American and Caribbean countries catch up with developed countries.
Instead, governments and international organizations should support education policies that have been shown to be effective, encourage research and evaluation of other types of education policies and programs, and back non-education policies and programs that improve the quality of life in developing countries.
The Elusive Legacy of 1968
"Dany, you have been so successful. But don't let yourself be manipulated by those far-left forces that would lead you to destroy everything that could arise from what you are creating."
Forty years later, those words on March 22, 1968, by Jean Baudrillard - then an assistant professor at Nanterre University - still sound right.
I may disappoint my supporters and those enticed by "The Revolution," but I'm not the leader of a revolution that allegedly occurred in 1968.
Forget it: ""68" is over - buried under cobblestones, even if those cobblestones made history and triggered radical change in our societies!
At first it seems baffling.
But, as I made clear at the time in my interview with Jean-Paul Sartre in Le Nouvel Observateur , I was only the loudspeaker for a rebellion.
Thus, ""68" symbolized the end of revolutionary myths - to the benefit of liberation movements extending from the 1970"s until now.
After all, the world of the 1960"s - the first global movement broadcast live on radio and TV - was defined by a variety of inter-connected revolts.
The change wrought by ""68" affected, above all, traditional culture, hidebound moralism, and the principle of hierarchical authority.
It altered social life, ways of being, ways of talking, ways of loving, and so on.
But, despite its scope, the movement steered clear of violence in order to create a new mode of rebellion.
Students, workers, and families - all had their legitimate demands, and all nonetheless converged on the same desire for emancipation.
The revolt was a form of political expression, but its aim was not to seize political power as such.
Indeed, its existential essence rendered it "politically untranslatable."
The desire for freedom that carried the movement forward necessarily eluded archaic modes of thinking.
As a result, the sterile categories of political tradition could gain no purchase on events.
In France, conservatism was so entrenched on both the left and the right that both missed the movement's meaning and could only fall back on stereotyped revolutionary interpretations. As for the anarchists, their utopia of widespread self-management - tied to outdated historical references - appeared entirely unsuitable.
Starting from an initial rejection of political institutions and parliamentarism, we understood only later that the democratic challenge lies in occupying a politically "normalized" space.
Faced with the anarchists, with their confining minimalist political grammar - reflected in the famous slogan elections, piege à cons ("elections, a trap for idiots") - and with the Communist Party, whose revolutionary ideal was eventually linked to totalitarian types of society, the future of May 1968 could only shift to the right with the election victory of General de Gaulle.
It was, undeniably, a political failure.
But just as undeniable was the huge tremor that shook our antediluvian conceptions of society, morals, and the state.
Challenging authoritarianism, the revolt triggered an explosion at the heart of the typically French two-headed power structure, which combined a dominant Gaullism and a Communist Party managing the working class.
Thus, the radicalism of the upheaval eventually liberated the pleasure to live.
With a new generation emerges a new political imagination and poetic mottos written on walls.
The surrealist essence of the rebellion was somehow symbolized by Gilles Caron's famous photograph, in which an insolent smile at a riot policeman subverts the frozen, established order to the point of making it ridiculous.
Of course, some people have never overcome the end of the ecstasy of those five weeks of craziness and joy, while others still wait for ""68" to culminate in God only knows what kind of "D-Day."
For my part, I accepted the "principle of reality" long ago, without nostalgia - and without minimizing the importance of what happened.
For ""68" was, indeed, a rebellion joining two eras.
It cracked the yoke of conservatism and totalitarian thought, enabling the desire for personal and collective autonomy and freedom to express itself.
From the cultural point of view, we won.
So, revisit ""68"?
Yes, but only in order to understand it, grasp its scope, and retain what still makes sense today.
Knowing, for example, that 23 years after World War II, a multicolored France demonstrated against my deportation by claiming "We are all German Jews" provides food for thought.
But this does not justify the hasty comparison - and even less the identification - of every protest today with ""68."
After 40 years, the context has changed radically.
The world of the Cold War is gone, as are schools and factories organized like barracks, authoritarian trade unions, gay bashing, and women's obligation to receive permission from their husbands before being able to work or open a bank account.
That world has been replaced by a multilateral world, which includes AIDS, unemployment, energy and climate crises, and so on.
So let's permit new generations to define their own battles and desires.
Demystifying ""68" also exposes the pretense of those who would blame it for all the wrongs of today's world.
Because the ""68 generation" wrote on the walls "It is forbidden to forbid," some hold it responsible for urban violence, extreme individualism, the crisis in education, executives" "golden parachutes," the decline of authority, and - why not? - climate change.
In this way, such people hope that they can evade their duty to explain today's problems.
But how can one not interpret this as a political trick aimed at sabotaging the modernization of expression, thereby closing off any space for rational debate?
The Elusive Search for Global Financial Rules
BRUSSELS - If the financial crisis is global, it is said, then the solution must be global: an international financial system that works better. And, because the Bretton Woods institutions (BWIs) - the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund - form the center of the international financial system, they must be included in the solution.
An enhanced international financial system must pursue two main lines of action.
The first is to broaden the scope of international cooperation.
At the moment, the Financial Stability Board, whose members include the G-20 countries, mainly pursues initiatives in this field.
A second line of action is to strengthen the international institutions" soft powers to aim for more consistent economic policies, especially by systemically important economies.
This would directly involve the Bretton Woods institutions, notably the IMF.
A strengthening of the IMF was agreed after the Asian crisis in the 1990"s, and the G-7 summit in Cologne in 1999 mandated the Fund to play a strong surveillance role to ensure greater transparency and encourage early adjustment by countries with unsustainable balance-of-payments positions.
But, over the last decade, the expectations raised by this mandate have not been met.
Some emerging economies did not let their currencies float but, instead, continued to peg them at undervalued exchange rates in order to promote their exports and build up reserves as a form of insurance in case of crisis.
Moreover, the IMF has not succeeded in convincing countries to pursue macroeconomic policies consistent with sustainable current-account positions.
Nor have advanced economies, particularly the United States, taken IMF advice fully into consideration.
The accumulation of large surpluses, especially in emerging Asian economies and oil-exporting countries, enabled the US to finance its current-account deficit. It also lowered long-term interest rates in the US and made monetary conditions there more expansionary.
Emerging economies, following the advanced countries, also attached less importance to Fund surveillance, especially as their accumulation of external assets made them less dependent on IMF financing and advice.
For example, the Fund has been unable to complete a surveillance program with China for three years.
All this occurred against the background of emerging-market economies" claims that their relatively low representation in the BWIs denied the IMF legitimacy.
In recent months, the Fund played an important role in resolving the crisis, in particular by assessing the gravity of the situation and providing countries with external finance.
But, if we are to create an international monetary system in which crises are the exception, the Fund must play a greater preventive role.
There seems to be a sense of denial in several countries that large external imbalances were a cause of the crisis.
These imbalances ultimately reflected the accumulation of excessive international liquidity by countries like the US, stemming from excessive savings by countries like China.
This spurred an unsustainable consumption boom, as well as unwarranted risk-taking by consumers and financial institutions, which contributed to the large distortions and bubbles in global financial markets that were the preconditions for the current crisis.
The risk now is that the forces favoring earlier and effective adjustment of imbalances have been weakened.
Indeed, few today are calling for the IMF to play a stronger role in preventing the accumulation of excessive external imbalances and in fostering more disciplined domestic policies.
An example of this is the way the IMF's Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members" Policies, aimed at identifying fundamental exchange-rate misalignments, was modified to allow greater discretion in surveillance, especially over exchange rates.
This might look like a tactical choice, but I doubt that it will result in a stronger hand for the IMF.
Emerging and developing countries are demanding a stronger voice in the IMF, but they also seem to be suggesting that they would like it to be less intrusive and less able to impose conditionality - while simultaneously providing more and cheaper financing.
This might be appropriate in times of systemic crisis, but it is not sustainable in normal times.
Indeed, some thought should be given to an exit strategy from cheap and unconditional IMF financing.
Instead, most IMF shareholders seem to favor making the organization's financing easier.
Enhancing the role of its Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), or supplementing the dollar with another world reserve currency, would help facilitate the financing needs of both deficit and surplus countries.
For deficit countries, borrowing from international institutions outside the markets would be easier, giving the issuer of such currency some form of international lender-of-last-resort function.
For surplus countries that want to accumulate reserves, it would reduce exchange-rate risk.
But, if financing were to become easier, it would be unclear how both creditors and debtors would perceive the risk of excessive imbalances.
The real danger is that adjustment would take place even later, with imbalances left to accumulate for a longer period of time.
Under these circumstances, crises could be even greater, and the adjustments harsher - as occurred under the last world currency, the gold standard.
A viable international financial system requires a mechanism to keep imbalances in check.
An essential element of such a mechanism is to give the IMF a prominent role in two areas: strong and effective surveillance in order to prevent crises, and responsible lending to countries in need, but with appropriate limits and conditionality.
We don't need to reinvent the wheel; we just need to follow up on the commitments made ten years ago.
Dealing with the short-run challenges of the current crisis should not distract us from the objective of preventing future meltdowns.
Emerging World Rising
LONDON - Now that the leadership issues in the United States and China have been settled, we can finally frame the economic outlook for 2013 with the knowledge of who will be pulling the policy levers in the world's two biggest economies.
So, what will they do - and, perhaps more important, what will economic forces do to them?
For starters, the US will face recurring challenges with the "fiscal cliff" until financial markets pressure policymakers into more radical deficit reduction.
But, despite this and associated growth disappointments, 2013 will be a stronger year for the global economy than many people expect.
In 2011, China contributed $1.3 trillion in additional GDP to the world, the equivalent of creating another Greece every 12.5 weeks, or close to another Spain every year.
Together, the four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) contributed around $2.2 trillion in 2012, equivalent to another Italy every year.
 (Despite its problems, Italy is still the world's eighth-largest economy, and will be for at least the next couple of years, until Russia and India possibly overtake it).
The eight growth market economies - the BRICs plus South Korea, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey - created close to $3 trillion in 2011, more than the United Kingdom in one year.
These economies" combined size is now approximately that of the US economy, with total annual output reaching $15-16 trillion, or roughly 25% of global GDP.
Unless their growth rates slow sharply, their contribution to world output will rise dramatically, and global growth will be stronger than worried Western analysts might appreciate.
If the "Growth Eight" economies expanded by 10% on average in US dollar terms, they would add $1.5 trillion to global GDP next year.
For the decade that began in 2011, we at Goldman Sachs Asset Management have assumed that China, which accounts for about half of total Growth Eight output (probably $8.3 trillion by the end of 2012), will grow at a 7-8% annual rate in real terms, with inflation around 3%.
Unless the renminbi falls in value, this translates into an average nominal increase of at least 10-11% in dollar terms.
China will grow by 7-8% partly because that is what policymakers have decided they want.
In late 2009, within a year of their massive policy stimulus in response to the global credit crisis, the Chinese leadership, I believe, decided that 10% annual real growth had outlived its usefulness.
Income inequality was rising dramatically, environmental damage was worsening rapidly, and inflation was leading to weak real-income growth for poor households.
Indeed, a key reason for China's slowdown in 2011-2012 is that officials wanted it.
While the real GDP growth rate stated in the 12th Five-Year Plan should not be viewed as a fait accompli, the fact that the Plan's growth rate was lowered to 7% is a powerful signal of official intent.
Looking ahead, while China's leadership change is important, the country's leaders cannot decide things with the freedom that one might think.
They become leaders partly through commitment to the agreed plan.
A potential leader who deviates too much does not stay in the leadership, as we saw in 2012 with the purge of Bo Xilai.
China's 7% growth target, while subject to a number of challenges, is based on maintaining private consumption growth of around 8% (while recognizing that exports and investment will not grow as strongly as before), thereby allowing the consumption share of GDP to rise.
More focus on innovation and creativity will be accompanied by strong real wage growth, provision of greater rights for urban migrants, and expansion of health care and pensions.
If China grows by 7-8% again in 2013, it will be more balanced growth than in 2012.
Beyond China, the other BRICs - Brazil, Russia, and India - all face challenges that their policymakers need to meet to spur stronger growth.
But there are plenty of exciting developments elsewhere, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Mexico - all part of what I call the "Next 11."
South Korea and Turkey, which continue to grow reasonably well, albeit not with the others" momentum, are two of this group's other big members.
The 15 countries that comprise the BRICs and the Next 11 contain more than four billion people, close to two-thirds of the world's population.
As they continue to grow, their share of the world economy will continue to rise, boosting global growth beyond what it otherwise would be.
But the global economy could be weaker in 2013 than it was in 2012 if the worst continues to prevail in Europe and the US, particularly if the new US Congress cannot work with a re-elected President Barack Obama to find a budget deal that improves the medium-term credibility of the US fiscal position while avoiding excessive deficit cutting.
This is a difficult balance to achieve, and, without pressure from the markets, I am unsure how it will play out.
I should add, however, that if the US government does not cause problems, two private-sector developments seem likely to be helpful.
One is growing evidence of a housing recovery; the other is the prospect of steadily declining energy-import costs as domestic production, particularly of natural gas, continues to rise.
As for Europe, many investors still assume that a moment will arrive when we can definitively conclude that European Monetary Union is finished or saved.
Unfortunately, it is much more likely that, at least ahead of Germany's autumn 2013 elections, key decisions will be postponed or avoided.
This means that Europe probably faces another challenging year.
But, again, the BRICs" output growth amounts to creating the equivalent of another Italy every 12 months.
Unless the European environment deteriorates sharply, Europe's travails will not be the main story for the global economy in 2013.
The Emerging-Market Growth Engine
NEW DELHI - The key role of emerging and developing countries - including India, China, and Brazil - in sustaining world economic growth was brought into sharp focus during the recent global crisis, and has been well documented.
This trend is likely to continue in 2011 and beyond.
Indeed, the IMF expects that emerging and developing economies will grow by 6% in 2010 and 6.3% in 2011.
Emerging-market economies have not only cushioned the global impact of the recent crisis, but have also helped industrialized countries reverse the recessionary trend of 2008-2009.
But recovery remains fragile in the developed world, with unemployment remaining at crisis levels.
But, while emerging economies are proving to be drivers of global demand, the right mix of government initiatives and policies is still required to ensure that they continue to provide the impetus for faster world economic recovery in the short term and be the engines of sustainable growth in the medium and long term.
There is also a strong need for supporting long-term capital flows to emerging economies to stimulate investment further, particularly in their infrastructure sectors, thereby injecting much-needed additional demand into the global economy.
In this regard, another important development is the increasing number of emerging-market middle-class consumers, their growing purchasing power, and thus their potential impact on global demand.
According to one estimate, middle-class consumers in a dozen emerging economies today wield annual purchasing power totaling approximately $6.9 trillion.
Indeed, projections from McKinsey &amp; Company suggest that the purchasing power of this rising middle class in emerging markets may rise to $20 trillion over the next decade - twice the current level of consumption in the United States.
The four biggest emerging economies - Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the BRICs) - are large producers and consumers of goods and services, and will also be important in shaping the pace, direction, and sustainability of global economic growth.
Let me turn to India specifically.
In the five years preceding the 2008-2009 crisis, the Indian economy grew at an average rate of nearly 9% annually.
During the crisis, annual growth slowed, but only to 6.7%, reflecting the economy's inherent resilience.
The growth rate subsequently recovered to 7.4% in 2009-2010, and we expect 9% growth by 2011-12.
The strength of the Indian economy is underpinned by a high saving rate and robust investment.
The government's prompt action to counter the crisis - fiscal stimulus, growth packages, and monetary easing - proved effective.
A sound financial and banking system with limited exposure to global markets, together with the importance of domestic consumption in sustaining demand, has also helped.
But what distinguishes India from other emerging economies, in particular China and the Southeast Asian countries, is that domestic demand, rather than exports, is the primary driver of growth.
A return to high growth rates globally will require a broader revival of demand.
Needless to say, this will occur only gradually, particularly in the developed countries.
Thus, India's high growth rates will have to remain dependent on strong domestic demand.
In order to meet this challenge, we are focusing on investments in infrastructure sectors such as power, telecommunications, roads, ports, and airports.
While the public sector will continue to play an important role, given the massive investment required, substantial private investment - including foreign investment - would be needed to address India's huge "infrastructure deficit" and the financing gap that accompanies it.
A strategy of private-public partnership has been adopted to address the infrastructure challenge.
At the same time, we need to invest in our human capital, supporting the development and upgrading of the workforce's skills and capacity for innovation.
At its summit in Seoul in November, the G-20 firmly placed development at the core of its agenda.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, underlining the importance of infrastructure investment, made the following proposal, which several leaders endorsed: "Recycling surplus savings into investment in developing countries will not only address the immediate demand imbalance, it will also help to address developmental imbalances.
In other words, we should leverage imbalances of one kind to redress imbalances of the other kind."
As we head into the second decade of the century, innovative ideas like using global savings or surpluses to finance infrastructure in emerging and developing countries should be pursued seriously.
Doing so would not only sustain the growth momentum of these economies, but would contribute to global recovery by generating much-needed additional demand in the developed countries.
While the emerging economies" global role will inevitably grow in the coming years, this shift will need to be anchored in a cooperative partnership with the developed world.
As for India, our resilient democratic values, ability to manage diversity, and strong economic fundamentals underpin our country's current global posture.
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Throughout the so-called "war on terror," the notion of a "clash of civilization" between Islam and the West has usually been dismissed as politically incorrect and intellectually wrongheaded.
Instead, the most common interpretation has been that the world has entered a new era characterized by conflict "within" a particular civilization, namely Islam, with fundamentalist Muslims as much at war against moderates as against the West.
The strategic conclusion derived from such an analysis was clear, ambitious, and easily summarized: democratization.
If the absence of democracy in the Islamic world was the problem, bringing democracy to the "Greater Middle-East would be the solution, and it was the historical duty of the United States, as the most powerful and moral nation, to bring about that necessary change.
The status quo was untenable.
Implementing democracy, with or without regime change, was the only alternative to chaos and the rise of fundamentalism.
Today, Iraq may be on the verge of civil war between Shiites and Sunnis.
Iran under a new and more radical president is moving irresistibly towards possessing a nuclear capacity.
A free electoral process brought Hamas to power in Palestine, and the unfortunate episode of the Danish newspaper cartoons illustrated the almost combustible nature of relations between Islam and the West.
All of these developments are paving the way to new interpretations.
Rather than a "clash of civilizations," we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
Indeed, it appears that the world is witnessing a triple conflict.
There is a clash within Islam, which, if the violence in Iraq spreads to neighboring countries, risks causing regional destabilization.
There is also a clash that is best described not as being between Islam and the West, but between the secularized world and a growing religious one.
At an even deeper and atavistic level, there is an emotional clash between a culture of fear and a culture of humiliation.
It would be a gross oversimplification to speak, as some are doing, of a clash between civilization and barbarism.
In reality, we are confronted with a widening divide over the role of religion, which runs between the West (with the US being a complicated exception) and much of the rest of the world (the most notable exception being China), but particularly the Islamic world.
The divide reflects how religion defines an individual's identity within a society.
At a time when religion is becoming increasingly important elsewhere, we Europeans have largely forgotten our (violent and intolerant) religious past, and we have difficulty understanding the role that religion can play in other peoples" daily lives.
In some ways, "they" are our own buried past and, with a combination of ignorance, prejudice, and, above all, fear, "we" are afraid that "they" could define our future.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
They have tried everything, from nationalism to regionalism, from communism to capitalism.
Since everything has failed, why not give God a chance?
Globalization may not have created these layers of conflicts, but it has accelerated them by making the differences more visible and palpable.
In our globalized age, we have lost the privilege - and, paradoxically, the virtue - of ignorance.
We all see how others feel and react, but without the minimal historical and cultural tools necessary to decipher those reactions.
Globalization has paved the way to a world dominated by the dictatorship of emotions - and of ignorance.
This clash of emotions is exacerbated in the case of Islam.
In the Arab world, in particular, Islam is dominated by a culture of humiliation felt by the people and nations that consider themselves the main losers, the worst victims, of a new and unjust international system.
From that standpoint, the Israel-Palestine conflict is exemplary.
It has become an obsession.
It is not so much that Arabs and Muslims really care about the Palestinians.
On the contrary, the Islamic world left the Palestinians without real support for decades.
In reality, for them the conflict has come to symbolize the anachronistic perpetuation of an unfair colonial order, to represent their political malaise, and to embody the perceived impossibility of their being masters of their destiny.
In the eyes of the Arabs (and some other Muslims), Israel's strength and resilience is a direct consequence of their own weakness, divisions, and corruption.
The majority of Arabs may not support al-Qaeda, but they do not oppose it with all their heart.
Instead, there is the temptation to regard Osama bin Laden as a type of violent Robin Hood, whose actions, while impossible to condone officially, have helped them to recover a sense of Arab pride and dignity.
Here, perhaps, is the real clash of civilizations: the emotional conflict between the European culture of fear and the Muslim, particularly Arab, culture of humiliation.
It would be dangerous to underestimate the depth of so wide an emotional divide, and to recognize its existence is the first step to overcoming it.
But that will be difficult, for transcending the emotional clash of civilizations presupposes an opening to the "other" that neither side may yet be ready to undertake.
The Empire of Human Rights
NEW YORK - Why are French, British, and American warships, but not Chinese or Malaysian warships, sitting near the Burmese coast loaded with food and other necessities for the victims of Cyclone Nargis?
Why has the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) been so slow and weak in its response to a natural calamity that ravaged one of its own members?
The French junior Human Rights Minister, Rama Yade, declared that the United Nations" principle of the "responsibility to protect" should be applied to Burma, forcibly if necessary.
And the Malaysian opposition leader Lim Kit Siang has said that Asian countries" inaction "reflects dismally on all ASEAN leaders and governments.
They can definitely do more."
So, are Europeans and Americans simply more compassionate than Asians?
Given the West's record of horrendous warfare and often brutal imperialism, this seems unlikely.
Moreover, the way ordinary Chinese rallied to help victims of the earthquake in Sichuan has been quite remarkable, as have been the spontaneous efforts of people in Burma to assist their fellow citizens, even as the military did very little.
Buddhism stresses compassion and mercy as much as Christianity does.
Indifference to suffering is not inherent to any Asian culture.
Indeed, none of the Asian members disagreed when the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.
The declaration held that "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world."
Nevertheless, there may be cultural differences in understanding how compassion should be applied.
The ideal of universal equality and rights does owe something to the history of Western civilization, from Socrates" "natural justice" to Christianity and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man.
Western peoples have not always lived up to their universalist ideals, but they have in modern times built institutions designed to implement them, in Europe and beyond.
There is, so far, no Asia-wide institution to protect the human rights of Asians, let alone mankind.
In fact, Chinese and other Asians frequently criticize the West for using human rights as an excuse to impose "Western values" on former colonial subjects.
To be sure, such accusations are especially common in autocracies whose rulers, and their apologists, view the idea of universal human rights as a threat to their monopoly on power.
But distrust of universalism in Asia is not confined to autocrats.
In many Asian countries, favors invariably create obligations, which is perhaps why people are sometimes disinclined to interfere in the problems of others.
You are obliged to take care of your family, your friends, or even your fellow countrymen. But the idea of universal charity is too abstract, and smacks of the kind of unwelcome interference that Western imperialists - and the Christian missionaries who followed them - practiced in the East for too long.
The notion of "Asian values," promoted mostly by Singaporean official scribes, was partly a critique of universalist Western claims.
Asians, according to this theory, have their own values, which include thrift, deference to authority, the sacrifice of individual to collective interests, and the belief that countries should not stick their noses into others" affairs.
Hence, the hesitant response of Southeast Asian governments - and public opinion - to the Burmese disaster.
One possible line of criticism of this kind of thinking is simply to claim the superiority of Western values.
But another, more sympathetic response would be to show that individual rights and notions of freedom are by no means alien to non-Western civilizations.
Amartya Sen, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has pointed out that great Indian rulers, such as Ashoka (third century BC) and Akbar (sixteenth century), advocated pluralism, tolerance, and reason long before the European Enlightenment.
He has also observed that famines don't occur in democracies, because freedom of information helps to prevent them.
Sen, not surprisingly, is a trenchant critic of the "Asian values" school.
It has, nonetheless, become a commonly held opinion that democracy, like universal human rights, is a typically Western idea, and that Asian autocracy, as practiced in China, for example, is not only more suited to Asians, but also more efficient.
Democratic governments are hampered by lobby groups, special interests, public opinion, party politics, and so forth, while Asian autocrats can make unpopular but necessary decisions.
The two recent natural disasters in Burma and China have put this idea to a severe test.
China has not fared too badly, largely because its government was forced by the Burmese example, bad publicity surrounding the Tibetan demonstrations, and the impending Olympic Games to allow far more freedom of information than it normally does.
One can only hope that this crack of freedom will widen in time.
Burma failed miserably, and, despite belated efforts to make the best of terrible circumstances, so has ASEAN.
In the end, of course, it doesn't matter much whether or not we ascribe the failures of autocracy and non-intervention to anything specifically "Asian."
Whatever the cause, the consequences remain deplorable.
Global Institutions after the Crisis
OXFORD - When Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial crisis erupted five years ago, many glimpsed a silver lining: the promise of more effective global economic governance.
But, despite a flurry of early initiatives, the world remains as far from that goal as ever.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB), established after the G-20 summit in London in April 2009, has no legal mandate or enforcement powers, nor formal processes for including all countries.
The International Monetary Fund still awaits the doubling of its capital (another early vow), while its existing resources are heavily tied up in Europe and its governance reforms are stalled.
The World Bank has received a modest increase in resources, but it has yet to build capacity to lend rapidly and globally beyond existing borrowers and loan arrangements, and its income trajectory is diminishing.
Yet the need for effective global economic governance remains more urgent than ever.
Banks and other financial firms roam internationally, greatly assisted by market-opening rules embedded in trade and investment treaties, but with no legally enforceable responsibility to provision adequately for their own losses when things go wrong.
Instead, massive risks have supposedly been held at bay by voluntary standards promulgated by a patchwork of public and private "standard-setting" organizations.
The crisis proved that this was inadequate.
The titans of Wall Street and the City of London were exposed as hugely over-leveraged.
Extraordinary profits when their bets paid off increased their financial and political power - which they still enjoy - with taxpayers left to bail them out when their bets turned bad.
The G-20 promised stronger global institutions to prevent this from recurring.
But the FSB is not a treaty-based global regulator with enforcement powers.
It continues to be a "standard setter" in a world with strong incentives to evade standards and negligible sanctions for doing so.
Furthermore, although the FSB's standards are ostensibly "universal," it does not represent all countries or have formal mechanisms to inform and consult them.
Regulators face a Sisyphean task, owing to the absence of strong and consistent political support for reining in the financial titans.
A well-resourced financial sector intensively lobbies the most influential governments in global finance.
The reforms of the IMF, another pillar of global financial management, cannot be implemented until the US Congress approves them - and there is no sign of that.
Even the new Basel 3 banking standards have been diluted and postponed.
For Brazil, Russia, India, and China, the delay in reforming the IMF is a serious annoyance.
They became major contributors to the Fund's emergency loan pool (the New Arrangements to Borrow) immediately after the crisis and now provide 15.5% of the NAB's resources.
But the greater voice and voting power that they were promised - commensurate with their status as four of the IMF's top ten shareholders - has not been delivered.
Even the selection of the organization's managing director remains a European droit du seigneur.
More seriously, an astounding 89.2% of the IMF's General Resources Account is outstanding to European countries, with just three countries (Greece, Portugal, and Ireland) accounting for 68%.
The IMF's resources are neither adequate nor available to respond to a crisis elsewhere.
Similarly, the G-20"s pledge in 2009 to protect the poorest and most fragile countries and communities from the effects of the crisis remains unfulfilled.
The World Bank is at the heart of these efforts, because it can pool risks globally and offset the capriciousness of official and private-sector aid flows, which create "donor darlings" (like Rwanda) and "donor orphans."
But, while the Bank has more than doubled its lending relative to the four years prior to 2008, this was achieved mostly by front-loading existing loans.
Crisis-hit countries that were not already borrowers were largely left out.
The Bank's failure to lend to new clients partly reflects its slowness.
Even after its loan cycle had been speeded up, the Bank took an average of 13.5 months to approve credits - a long time for a country to await "emergency" help.
But the Bank is also hampered by worsening resource constraints, as the biggest post-crisis capital infusions went to regional development banks.
The African Development Bank's capital was increased by 200%, as was the Asian Development Bank's.
The Inter-American Development Bank got a 70% increase.
Meanwhile, the World Bank received an increase of 30%, while its lending arm for the poorest countries, the International Development Association, received an increase of only 18%.
Crucially, it is not obvious that the Bank has "buy-in" from emerging economies, with Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which pledged significant resources to the IMF, pledging only about 1% of IDA funding.
Further exacerbating the Bank's financial woes, its powerful creditors have opted to "pull back" its lending in order to protect its resources.
As a result, compared to the regional development banks, the Bank will be lending less to fee-paying clients, who provide income, and engaging in more "concessional lending," which does not.
The 2008 crisis highlighted the need for international cooperation to regulate finance and mitigate the effects of a crisis.
Yet the global resources and instruments needed to manage (if not avert) the next crisis have not been secured.
Instead, regions and countries are quietly finding their own ways to manage finance, create pooled emergency funds, and strengthen development finance - an outcome that heralds a more fragmented and decentralized set of regulatory regimes and a modest de-globalization of finance and aid.
The End of an Era in Finance
CAMBRIDGE - In the world of economics and finance, revolutions occur rarely and are often detected only in hindsight.
But what happened on February 19 can safely be called the end of an era in global finance.
On that day, the International Monetary Fund published a policy note that reversed its long-held position on capital controls.
Taxes and other restrictions on capital inflows, the IMF's economists wrote, can be helpful, and they constitute a "legitimate part" of policymakers" toolkit.
Rediscovering the common sense that had strangely eluded the Fund for two decades, the report noted: "logic suggests that appropriately designed controls on capital inflows could usefully complement" other policies.
As late as November of last year, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn had thrown cold water on Brazil's efforts to stem inflows of speculative "hot money," and said that he would not recommend such controls "as a standard prescription."
So February's policy note is a stunning reversal - as close as an institution can come to recanting without saying, "Sorry, we messed up." But it parallels a general shift in economists" opinion.
It is telling, for example, that Simon Johnson, the IMF's chief economist during 2007-2008, has turned into one of the most ardent supporters of strict controls on domestic and international finance.
The IMF's policy note makes clear that controls on cross-border financial flows can be not only desirable, but also effective.
This is important, because the traditional argument of last resort against capital controls has been that they could not be made to stick.
Financial markets would always outsmart the policymakers.
Even if true, evading the controls requires incurring additional costs to move funds in and out of a country - which is precisely what the controls aim to achieve.
Otherwise, why would investors and speculators cry bloody murder whenever capital controls are mentioned as a possibility?
If they really couldn't care less, then they shouldn't care at all.
One justification for capital controls is to prevent inflows of hot money from boosting the value of the home currency excessively, thereby undermining competitiveness.
Another is to reduce vulnerability to sudden changes in financial-market sentiment, which can wreak havoc with domestic growth and employment.
To its credit, the IMF not only acknowledges this, but it also provides evidence that developing countries with capital controls were hit less badly by the fallout from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.
The IMF's change of heart is important, but it needs to be followed by further action.
We currently don't know much about designing capital-control regimes.
The taboo that has attached to capital controls has discouraged practical, policy-oriented work that would help governments to manage capital flows directly.
There is some empirical research on the consequences of capital controls in countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Malaysia, but very little systematic research on the appropriate menu of options.
The IMF can help to fill the gap.
Emerging markets have resorted to a variety of instruments to limit private-sector borrowing abroad: taxes, unremunerated reserve requirements, quantitative restrictions, and verbal persuasion.
In view of the sophisticated nature of financial markets, the devil is often in the details - and what works in one setting is unlikely to work well in others.
For example, Taiwan's use of administrative measures that rely heavily on close monitoring of flows may be inappropriate in settings where bureaucratic capacity is more limited.
Similarly, Chilean-style unremunerated reserve requirements may be easier to evade in countries with extensive trading in sophisticated derivatives.
With the stigma on capital controls gone, the IMF should now get to work on developing guidelines on what kind of controls work best and under what circumstances.
The IMF provides countries with technical assistance in a wide range of areas: monetary policy, bank regulation, and fiscal consolidation.
It is time to add managing the capital account to this list.
With this battle won, the next worthy goal is a global financial transaction tax.
Set at a very low level - 0.05% is a commonly mentioned rate - such a tax would raise hundreds of billions of dollars for global public goods while discouraging short-term speculative activities in financial markets.
Support for a global financial-transaction tax is growing.
A group of NGOs have rechristened it the "Robin Hood tax," and have launched a global campaign to promote it, complete with a deliciously biting video clip featuring British actor Bill Nighy (www.robinhoodtax.org).
Significantly, the European Union has thrown its weight behind the tax and urged the IMF to pursue it.
The only major holdout is the United States, where Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has made his distaste for the proposal clear.
What made finance so lethal in the past was the combination of economists" ideas with the political power of banks.
The bad news is that big banks retain significant political power.
The good news is that the intellectual climate has shifted decisively against them.
Shorn of support from economists, the financial industry will have a much harder time preventing the fetish of free finance from being tossed into the dustbin of history.
The End of Austria\u0027s Social Partnership?
Few changes of government in Europe attract sensational journalism of the type that Austria's October 1999 elections - which brought Jörg Haider's Freedom Party into government - did.
Two years later, with the EU sanctions imposed after the government's formation now lifted, it is time to assess the impact of this government on Austria's economy, the field where the ruling coalition's pre-election rhetoric promised the biggest changes. 
To understand what Austria's government is doing, it is necessary to understand where Austria has been.
Austria's economy performed solidly throughout the 1990s, roughly in line with EU and Euro Area averages.
Yet, due to Austria's accession to the EU in 1995 and the country's trade and investment in reshaping neighboring economies in Eastern Europe, many Austrians expected higher growth. 
Two factors incited Austria's lower than expected economic dynamics: delayed fiscal consolidation and lagging structural reforms.
Efforts at fiscal consolidation in the 1990s were usually followed by wider structural deficits, and although market reforms were discussed, few were implemented.
Both problems contributed to the breakdown of the long-ruling coalition government of Social Democrats and Conservatives (the Volkspartei). 
The Conservative and Freedom Party coalition formed after the 1999 elections confronted a difficult job.
Although the program of the coalition partners shared many points, a contradiction existed concerning Europe.
By introducing more flexibility in product and labor markets and by committing itself to overhaul public sector management, the Conservatives hoped that Austria would increase its competitiveness and thus achieve higher growth. 
In contrast, the Freedom Party has never been Pro-European, at least since 1990; nor has it been open to EU accession by former communist states in Eastern Europe.
The EU sanctions imposed on Austria after the election boosted the Freedom Party by attracting anti-European sentiments within Austria to it.
As a consequence, it remains unclear whether or not Austria's current government looks at Europe and EU expansion eastward as a basis on which to secure a better international profile and added growth. 
Early on in its tenure, the coalition government initiated a stability program designed to eliminate the government's deficit by 2002.
This goal may be achieved this year, mainly by raising revenues in the form of higher indirect taxes (e.g., levies on electricity, increases on the vehicle insurance tax, tobacco tax, as well as by introducing tuition fees at universities). Stricter corporate taxes were also adopted. 
On the expenditure side, structural measures were implemented, notably pension reform as well as phased reductions in government employment and a more focused targeting of social transfers.
But these expenditure restraints are occurring only slowly, which means that the stability program is front-loaded with an increased tax burden reaching unprecedented levels. 
These steps towards a balanced budget were, in part, courageous because they stirred up resistance by the people and institutions affected.
Some measures were well-designed, such as reform of the state pension system (although a need for further reform remains) - while others, such as the measures aimed at raising revenues and reducing costs in the health care system, were too hastily implemented - e.g. the new system of health co-payments requires redesign.
Moreover, so far, health care reform has failed to yield the savings that were expected. 
The new government also began to change broad areas of public administration.
It reduced government employment, granted only moderate wage increases and slashed public investment.
All this helped consolidate the budget but created a climate of opposition. 
Administrative reforms normally require meticulous preparation, which the government tried to generate quickly through a study conducted by the Task Reform Commission, which was published in March 2001.
So far, suggestions as to how to raise public sector efficiency are numerous, but legislative initiatives, based on the Commission's suggestions, are rare or have not been worked out satisfactorily. 
Admittedly, it is politically difficult to turn government agencies into more entrepreneurial units.
Past experience in Austria has shown few positive examples.
One reason may be that entrepreneurial spin-offs were often created with unrealistic goals and without any thorough analyses of the expected benefits and costs. 
In 2000 and 2001, many state holdings in industry were privatized, sharply reducing the debt position of the mother company of the nationalized industries (ÖIAG).
Its debts stem from a decision, taken by the old coalition government, whereby the losses of nationalized industries were assumed by the state.
In addition to continued privatization, many policy measures were initiated by the new government that aimed to improve the functioning of the market: e.g., opening the electricity and gas markets to competition ahead of other EU countries, opening the telecommunication sector, strengthening equity markets through changes in the tax system, unification of financial market supervision and other measures. 
Despite these reforms, many inflexibilities remain.
For example, shop opening-hours still must comply with highly restrictive rules.
Indeed, within the OECD, Austria retains one of the tightest retail sector regulations.
Many labor market inflexibilities also persist. 
But a deeper question about the nature of Austria's political/economic system remains unanswered.
Austria's economic success and political stability after World War II was premised on a system of social partnership.
Economic policy was often determined by the four social partners: the Chamber of Commerce, the association of Chambers of Agriculture, the Chamber of Labor, and the Austrian Trade Union.
The first are associated with the Conservatives, the latter two with the Social Democrats.
The formation of the Conservative/Freedom Party coalition government called that partnership into question. 
The short-term consequences of this may not be negative, since it was a lack of agreement among the social partners that caused the structural problems of the 1990s to go unresolved.
So the current government's efforts to resolve them may be helpful. But the long-term consequences of a breakdown in the social partnership remain unknown.
Given that social partnership delivered stability and prosperity to Austria for decades, it must be hoped that today's changes serve as a catalyst for renewed social consensus. 
The End of Banks?
BARCELONA ­- Are banks doomed as a result of the current financial crisis?
The securitization of mortgages originally was seen as a triumph, because it shifted risk to financial markets, while taking deposits and making and monitoring loans - the purview of traditional banks - was regarded as narrow and old-fashioned.
By contrast, modern banks would seek finance mainly in the interbank market and securitize their loan portfolios.
In theory, such banks should be immune to runs, because the interbank market is supposed to be extremely efficient, and risk would be shifted to investors willing to bear it.
Deposits would be replaced by mutual funds, which, as we know, are also immune to runs, and the risk of structured investment vehicles (SIV's) would be assessed accurately by rating agencies.
All this financial engineering would avoid the obsolete capital requirements that burden banks" operation.
The current crisis killed off  this optimistic scenario.
The interbank market has almost collapsed, because banks do not trust each other in the same way that we tend not to trust an eager seller of a second-hand car.
This is a textbook market failure.
The origin of the problem is uncertainty about banks" exposure to sub-prime mortgages, the risks of which have been carelessly assessed by rating agencies due to conflicts of interest.
Northern Rock in the United Kingdom has been a victim of this modern banking strategy, as has Bear Stearns in the United States.
Others may follow soon.
Moreover, institutions that thought they had transferred risk to the market realized that the demise of sponsored SIV's would damage their reputations irreversibly.
This implied that they had to rescue these SIV's.
Alas, they failed to set aside enough capital for this unforeseen contingency, and external investors such as the sovereign wealth funds of China, Singapore, and the Middle East have had to come to the rescue.
Finally, mutual funds are at risk as well, because their supposedly safe investments may sour and the insurance that backs them now appears shaky.
The sub-prime contamination of money market funds would prove disastrous, with consequences far beyond what we have seen up to now.
The supposed transfer of risk would turn out to have been a mirage.
Are banks, markets, or regulators to blame?
The answer may indicate what future awaits banks.
Some regulators were irresponsible for not anticipating the rational profit-maximizing behavior of institutions with a limited liability charter and of executives effectively protected from failure.
After all, what should banks do when, instead of keeping sub-prime mortgages on their books, monitoring their performance, and incurring capital requirements, they can securitize them advantageously (because the rating agencies have a stake in the business), avoid capital requirements, and profit from investors" inexperience with such products.
Indeed, even if things turned ugly and banks" equity suffered, executives knew that their own generous bonuses and pension packages most likely would not.
Given this, regulators should have thought twice before permitting off-balance sheet operations without any further provision.
The fundamental question today is who monitors opaque loans, whether of the sub-prime or any other variety.
Traditionally, the answer was banks; in the securitized world, it remains a question.
So, is there an alternative to the old-fashioned monitoring of loans by banks?
Perhaps if those securitized packages had been properly rated, the originating institution would be obliged to retain a share to signal to the market that risk was being controlled.
And, clearly, the idea that capital requirements were not needed for banks" off-balance sheet activities (because the banks were not bearing the risk), was simply wrong.
Appropriate regulation - including regulation of rating agencies - would most likely make traditional banks popular again.
A reconsideration of banks" limited liability charter would go even further in restoring credibility.
The principle is simple: when your own money is at stake, you tend to be careful.
But when you can play with others" money and expect a very high reward for success and no punishment for failure, the incentives for irresponsible risk-taking become enormous.
America's Bond-Market Blues
BEIJING - The market for United States Treasury securities is one of the world's largest and most active debt markets, providing investors with a secure stock of value and a reliable income stream, while helping to lower the US government's debt-servicing costs.
But, according to the US Treasury Department, overseas investors sold a record $54.5 billion in long-term US debt in April of this year, with China slashing its holdings by $5.4 billion.
This dumping of US government debt by foreign investors heralds the end of an era of cheap financing for the US.
As it stands, the US government holds roughly 40% of its debt through the Federal Reserve and government agencies like the Social Security Trust Fund, while American and foreign investors hold 30% each.
Emerging economies - many of which use large trade surpluses to drive GDP growth and supplement their foreign-exchange reserves with the resulting capital inflows - are leading buyers of US debt.
Over the last decade, these countries" foreign-exchange reserves have swelled from $750 billion to $6.3 trillion - more than 50% of the global total - providing a major source of financing that has effectively suppressed long-term US borrowing costs.
With yields on US ten-year bonds falling by 45% annually, on average, from 2000 to 2012, the US was able to finance its debt on exceptionally favorable terms.
But the ongoing depreciation of the US dollar - which has fallen by almost half since the Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1971 - together with the rising volume of US government debt, undermines the purchasing power of investors in US government securities.
This diminishes the value of these countries" foreign-exchange reserves, endangers their fiscal and exchange-rate policies, and undermines their financial security.
Nowhere is this more problematic than in China, which, despite the recent sell-off, remains by far America's largest foreign creditor, accounting for more than 22% of America's foreign-held debt.
Chinese demand for Treasuries has enabled the US to increase its government debt almost threefold over the last decade, from roughly $6 trillion to $16.7 trillion.
This, in turn, has fueled a roughly 28% annual expansion in China's foreign-exchange reserves.
China's purchases of American debt effectively transferred the official reserves gained via China's trade surplus back to the US market.
In early 2000, China held only $71.4 billion of US debt and accounted for 8% of total foreign investment in the US.
By the end of 2012, this figure had reached $1.2 trillion, accounting for 22% of inward foreign investment.
But China's reserves have long suffered as a result, yielding only 2% on US ten-year bonds, when they should be yielding 3-5%.
Meanwhile, outward foreign direct investment yields 20% annually, on average.
So, whereas China's $3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves will yield only about $100 billion annually, its $1.53 trillion in foreign direct investment could bring in annual returns totaling around $300 billion.
Despite such low returns, China has continued to invest its reserves in the US, largely owing to the inability of its own under-developed financial market to generate a sufficient supply of safe assets.
In the first four months of this year, China added $44.3 billion of US Treasury securities to its reserves, meaning that such debt now accounts for 38% of China's total foreign-exchange reserves.
But the growing risk associated with US Treasury bonds should prompt China to reduce its holdings of US debt.
The US Federal Reserve's announcement in May that it may wind down its quantitative easing (QE) program - that is, large-scale purchases of long-term financial assets - by the end of this year has sparked fears of a 1994-style bond-market collapse.
Concerns that a sharp rise in interest rates will cause the value of bond portfolios to plummet have contributed to the recent wave of foreign investors dumping US debt - a trend that is likely to continue to the extent that the Fed follows through on its exit from QE.
Yields on ten-year US bonds are now 2.94%, a 58% increase since the first quarter of this year, causing the interest-rate gap between two- and ten-year bonds to widen to 248 basis points.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the yield rate on ten-year bonds will continue to rise, reaching 5% by 2019 and remaining at or above that level for the next five years.
While it is unlikely that this will lead to a 1994-style disaster, especially given that the current yield rate remains very low by historical standards, it will destabilize the US debt market.
For China, the benefits of holding large quantities of US dollars no longer outweigh the risks, so it must begin to reduce the share of US securities in its foreign-exchange reserves.
Given that China will reduce the overall size of its reserves as its population ages and its economic-growth model shifts toward domestic consumption, a substantial sell-off of US debt is inevitable - and, with it, a large and permanent increase in America's financing costs.
The End of China's Surplus
CAMBRIDGE - China's current-account surplus - the combination of its trade surplus and its net income from foreign investments - is the largest in the world.
With a trade surplus of $190 billion and the income from its nearly $3 trillion portfolio of foreign assets, China's external surplus stands at $316 billion, or 6.1% of annual GDP.
Because the current-account surplus is denominated in foreign currencies, China must use these funds to invest abroad, primarily by purchasing government bonds issued by the United States and European countries.
As a result, interest rates in those countries are lower than they would otherwise be.
That may all be about to change.
The policies that China will adopt as part of its new five-year plan will shrink its trade and current-account surpluses.
It is possible that, before the end of the decade, China's current-account surplus will move into deficit, as the country imports more than it exports and spends its foreign-investment income on imports rather than on foreign securities.
If that happens, China will no longer be a net buyer of US and other foreign bonds, putting upward pressure on interest rates in those countries.
Although this scenario might now seem implausible, it is actually quite likely to occur.
After all, the policies that China will implement in the next few years target the country's enormous saving rate - the cause of its large current-account surplus.
In any country, the current-account balance is the difference between national saving and national investment in plant and equipment, housing, and inventories.
This key fact is not a matter of economic theory or an historic regularity.
It is a fundamental national-income accounting identity that must hold for every country in every year.
So any country that reduces its saving without cutting its investment will see its current-account surplus decline.
China's national saving rate - including household saving and business saving - is now about 45% of its GDP, which is the highest rate in the world.
But, looking ahead, the five-year plan will cause the saving rate to decline, as China seeks to increase consumer spending and therefore the standard of living of the average Chinese.
The plan calls for a shift to higher real wages so that household income will rise as a share of GDP.
Moreover, state-owned enterprises will be required to pay out a larger portion of their earnings as dividends.
And the government will increase its spending on consumption services like health care, education, and housing.
These policies are motivated by domestic considerations, as the Chinese government seeks to raise living standards more rapidly than the moderating growth rate of GDP.
Their net effect will be to raise consumption as a share of GDP and to reduce the national saving rate.
And with that lower saving rate will come a smaller current-account surplus.
Since China's current-account surplus is now 6% of its GDP, if the saving rate declines from the current 45% to less than 39% - still higher than any other country - the surplus will become a deficit.
This outlook for the current-account balance does not depend on what happens to the renminbi's exchange rate against other currencies.
The saving-investment imbalance is fundamental, and it alone determines a country's external position.
But the fall in domestic saving is likely to cause the Chinese government to allow the renminbi to appreciate more rapidly.
Higher domestic consumer spending would otherwise create inflationary pressures.
Allowing the currency to appreciate will help to offset those pressures and restrain price growth.
A stronger renminbi would reduce the import bill, including prices for oil and other production inputs, while making Chinese goods more expensive for foreign buyers and foreign goods more attractive to Chinese consumers.
This would cause a shift from exports to production for the domestic market, thereby shrinking the trade surplus, in addition to curbing inflation.
China's trade surplus and the renminbi's exchange rate were high on the list of topics that President Hu Jintao and US President Barack Obama discussed when Hu visited Washington earlier this month.
The Americans are eager for China to reduce its surplus and allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly.
But they should be careful what they wish for, because a lower surplus and a stronger renminbi imply a day when China is no longer a net buyer of US government bonds.
The US should start planning for that day now.
The End of Fiscal Sovereignty in Europe
MILAN - The late Milton Friedman said that a common currency - that is, a monetary union - cannot be sustained without a deep form of economic and political union.
By this, he meant an open economy that ensures the free flow of goods, labor, and capital, together with a disciplined central fiscal authority and a strong central bank.
The latter two are pillars of a strong currency. They work in tandem.
But the other pieces are no less important.
The eurozone, currently wrestling with fiscal imbalance and sovereign debt risk, has a strong and autonomous central bank, but is fiscally fragmented and only partly unified politically.
Enter the Maastricht Treaty, which in theory imposes fiscal discipline by placing limits on government deficits and debt levels - clearly a structure designed to prevent free riding on the fiscal discipline of others.
Maastricht was thus intended to prevent a situation like the current one in Greece.
It didn't work.
Eurozone sovereign debt turned out not to be homogenous with respect to risk.
In a stable world, Maastricht Treaty's rules-based framework, if enforced, might do the job.
But in a shock-prone world, it is a fragile system, because it precludes anything but modest countercyclical policy.
No wonder, then, that the treaty's strict limits were breached early in the euro's first decade bycore countries as well as peripheral ones.
Indeed, with a large shock, much of the breach happens automatically, as tax revenues shrink and social-insurance payments expand.
Recent analysis by the International Monetary Fund suggests that as much as 80% of the fiscal stimulus in advanced countries during the current crisis is non-discretionary.
That kind of built-in counter-cyclicality is not a bad thing.
But if it produces the threat of fiscal instability and excessive sovereign-debt risk after a large shock, then the starting point was not sufficiently conservative - in other words, deficits or debt levels (or both) were too high.
Counter-cyclicality does not mean running modest deficits in the good times and huge deficits in major downturns.
If the current EU budget rules are too rigid and are ignored in the face of a shock, then the door is open for imprudent fiscal behavior.
In theory, strict in-depth monitoring could distinguish genuinely prudent countercyclical responses from profligacy.
But in practice it is hard to enforce.
The eurozone's immediate challenge is declining fiscal stability in a subset of countries whose credit ratings are falling and debt-service costs rising.
Absent external assistance and a credible plan for restoring fiscal order, Greek sovereign debt could not be rolled over, forcing a default, probably in the form of a restructuring of Greek debt.
Even with external assistance, many view default as a near certainty, because the arithmetic of restoring fiscal balance is so daunting.
Eurozone membership precludes inflation and devaluation as adjustment mechanisms.
An alternative is domestic deflation combined with extreme fiscal tightening - that is, a period of slow or negative growth in wages, incomes, and some prices of non-traded goods.
But deflation is painful and cannot realistically be pursued for political reasons.
The constraints for eurozone countries are similar to those of a state in America that gets into fiscal trouble.
Devaluation is not an option because of the common currency. The Federal Reserve will not willingly resort to inflation.
Moreover, in the United States, there are rules and conventions (similar to Maastricht) that disallow or discourage states from running long-term deficits.
This means that state fiscal behavior tends to be pro-cyclical in the face of large shocks like the recent one.
So why isn't a federal system equally fragile?
There are two key safety valves.
One is the central government's ability to run deficits and to act decisively.
The other is labor mobility.
The EU does not have a robust centralized fiscal structure with a counter-cyclical mandate.
And labor mobility, a long-run goal in the EU, is constrained by language, laws, and diverse regulatory regimes. 
In addition, state bonds are not treated as equals, and the markets penalize profligate states.
If the EU wants a monetary union in which sovereign debt is relatively homogenous with respect to risk, fiscal discipline must be similarly homogenous.
But that also means that it will need a more robust mechanism for countercyclical responses to shocks.
The EU's leaders recently stated their intention to revisit the Maastricht structure, which in principle is a good idea.
They might take the route of adapting the Maastricht rules to allow for more inter-temporal flexibility at the national level.
But that approach would be complicated. One would need a sophisticated capability for monitoring and enforcing fiscal policy and sovereign debt - or else end up with a repeat of the current situation.
A better long-term solution is a central EU fiscal capacity that accumulates the resources to respond to shocks during periods of growth.
One could think of it as a stabilization tax that becomes negative in downturns.
But a move in this direction does involve some degree of fiscal centralization.
