if high national debt is associated with slow economic growth , is it because excessive debt impe@@ des growth , or because slow growth causes countries to accumul@@ ate more debt ?

among its many interest@@ ing statisti@@ cs , it t@@ ells you how many jobs are created and where ; how ear@@ nings and hours worked are e@@ vol@@ ving ; and the number , age , and education of those seeking employment .
